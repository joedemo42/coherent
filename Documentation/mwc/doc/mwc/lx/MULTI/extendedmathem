.PP
In addition to the 22 mathematics functions described in the Standard,
\*(PN includes the following extended mathematics functions:
.DS
.ta 0.4i 1.2i
	\fBcabs\fR	Compute complex absolute value
	\fBhypot\fR	Calculate hypotenuse
	\fBj0\fR	Compute Bessel function for order 0
	\fBj1\fR	Compute Bessel function for order 1
	\fBjn\fR	Compute Bessel function for order \fIn\fR
.DE
.PP
These functions are declared in the header
.BR xmath.h .
In previous releases of \*(PN, they had been declared in the
header
.BR math.h .
This change was made to conform to the Standard.
.PP
A program that uses any of these routines no longer conforms strictly
to the Standard, and may not be portable to other compilers or
environments.
