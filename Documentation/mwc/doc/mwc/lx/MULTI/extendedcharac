.PP
In addition to the character-handling functions described in the Standard,
\*(PN includes the following extended character-handling functions
and macros:
.DS
.ta 0.4i 1.5i
	\fB_tolower\fR	Change a character to lower case
	\fB_toupper\fR	Change a character to upper case
	\fBisascii\fR	See if a character is in the ASCII character set
	\fBtoascii\fR	Convert a character to printable ASCII
.DE
.PP
These functions and macros are declared or defined in the header
.BR xctype.h .
In previous releases of \*(PN, they had been declared in the header
.BR ctype.h .
This change was made to conform to the Standard, and may require that
some code be altered.
.PP
A program that uses any of these routines no longer conforms strictly
to the Standard, and may not be portable to other compilers or
environments.
