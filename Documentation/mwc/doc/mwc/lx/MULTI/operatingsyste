\*(OS gives names to its logical devices.
\*(PN uses these names to
access these devices via \*(OS.
.PP

.if \nX=1 \{\
.DS
.ta 0.4i 2.0i
	\fBaux\fR	Auxiliary (serial) port
	\fBcom1\fR	Serial port
	\fBcon\fR	Console
	\fBlpt1\fR	Parallel port; not always implemented
	\fBnul\fR	Null device (the \*(QLbit bucket\*(QR)
	\fBprn\fR	Parallel port
.DE \}
.if \nX=2 \{\
.DS
.ta 0.4i 2.0i
	\fBaux:\fR	Auxiliary port
	\fBcon:\fR	Console
	\fBprn:\fR	Parallel port

You can use the function
.B fopen
to open these devices, just as if they were files.
However, if you attempt to seek on a device, undefined behavior will occur.
