.TH "nested comments" "" "" Definition

.PP
Both \*(KR and the draft ANSI standard declare that comments cannot be nested.
Earlier versions of \*(PN included a switch, called
.if \nX<3 \fB\-VCNEST\fR,
.if \nX=3 \fB\NESTEDCOMMENTS\fR,
that allowed a programmer to nest comments.
This switch has been removed.
Current and future versions of \*(PN abort compilation when they
detect nested comments.
