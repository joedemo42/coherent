.PP
The ANSI Standard forbids any ANSI header to declare or define any
function or macro that is not described within the Standard.
Therefore, the routines
.if \nX=1 \{\
.BR fdopen ,
.BR fgetw ,
.BR fileno ,
.BR fputw ,
.BR getanb ,
.BR getcnb ,
.BR getw ,
.BR lseek ,
.BR putanb ,
.BR putcnb ,
and
.B putw \}
.if \nX=2 \{\
.BR fdopen ,
.BR fgetw ,
.BR fileno ,
.BR fputw ,
.BR getw ,
and
.B putw \}
have been moved from header
.B stdio.h
into the header
.BR xstdio.h .
.PP
Any programs that uses any of these extended functions will not comply
strictly with the Standard, and may not be portable to other compilers
or environments.
