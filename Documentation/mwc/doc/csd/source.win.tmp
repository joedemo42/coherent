.Sh "Source window"
.II "source window"
.PP
The source window contains the source code of the program you
are debugging.
The cursor appears in this window when you first invoke \fBcsd\fR.
To return to this window from another screen or window, type the
.BK 8
key.
.PP
If your program is more than one screen long (about 19 lines),
not all of your program can be displayed at one time.
To scroll through your program one line at a time,
use the \*(Fu and \*(Fd arrow keys.
The \*(FD and \*(FP
keys move through your source program one \fBpage\fR (or screen full of text)
at a time.
Finally, the \*(Fb and \*(Fe
keys jump to the beginning or the end, respectively,
of your entire source file.
.PP
If you want to look at a line that contains a specific string, use
the
.BK 1
key.
.II "find^pattern"
.II "pattern"
This provides a powerful search feature with which you can find
a specific string and locate the next statement to be traced.
The
.BK 1
key is discussed in more detail later in this section.
.PP
To execute your program, press the
.BK 4
key, then one of the following:
.IP "\fB<F3>\fR" 1.0i
Execute to the next tracepoint.
.IP "\fB<return>\fR" 1.0i
Execute one line of code.
.IP "\fB\*(Fd\fR" 1.0i
Same as <return>, but function calls are
.br
treated as one statement.
.IP "\fB\*(FL\fR" 1.0i
Execute to the end of the current function.
.IP "\fB\*(\Fb\fR" 1.0i
Reload and initialize program.
.IP "\fB\*(Fe\fR" 1.0i
Execute to the end of the program;
.br
do not stop at tracepoints.
.PP
.II "current statement key"
If you have been moving through your source window
and have lost track of what the next executable statement is,
press the
.II "\*(B4fB\*(Fc\*(B4fR"
.BK c
key.
This will automatically position the cursor
at the next executable statement.
.PP
When \fBcsd\fR stops at a tracepoint in your source program,
the cursor is positioned at the beginning of the traced source line,
which is the next line to be executed.
.PP
\fBcsd\fR displays both the source window and the evaluation
window at the same time.
The boundary between them is a reverse-video line that names
the source file being displayed.
If your program uses more than one source file,
the name will change as you scroll from one file to another.
\fBcsd\fR displays the source files
in the order in which you entered them on the
\fBcc\fR command line.
.PP
You can change the relative sizes of the evaluation and source windows
with the
.BK 2
key, which will be described later in this section.
