This directory holds the sources for the manual for CSD, the C source
debugger for MS-DOS and the Atari ST.  To re-build the manual, uncompress
all of the files, then type "Run".

NB, you probably will have to rewrite most of the Run scripts as they
invoke macro packages that no longer exist, and use techniques that are
truly bogus.  Good luck.
