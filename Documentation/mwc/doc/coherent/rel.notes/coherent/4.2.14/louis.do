Under UNIX, we should call them drive 0 and drive 1.  I assume you
mean drive 0 here.  Where is the entry for the second drive's
num. cyl?  Also they would probably want the full geometry for
any type of AT drive (IDE, RLL, etc.).  So maybe expand the question
to what is the geometry: cyl, heads, spt, and just plain size.
