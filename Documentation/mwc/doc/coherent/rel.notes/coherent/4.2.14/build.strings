The next step in installation is to scan each COHERENT partition on the
drives for bad blocks.  This will not write to the partition being scanned.
Be patient.  This takes a few minutes.
Partition %d (%s) already contains a COHERENT filesystem.
You can skip scanning it for bad blocks if you choose.
Do you want to scan %s for bad blocks
Partition %d (%s) is on an AT drive.  Only non-IDE AT drives require
badscanning.  If this partition is on an IDE drive, you may skip
scanning it for bad blocks if you choose.
Partition %d (%s) appears to be on a SCSI device.  Normally, SCSI drives
do not need to be badscanned unless they contain removeable media.  You
may skip scanning it for bad blocks if you choose.
Do you want to scan %s for bad blocks
Scanning partition %d:
/etc/badscan -v -o %s %s %s
The next step is to copy some COHERENT files from the diskette to the
root filesystem of your hard disk.  This will take a few minutes...
/etc/mount %s /mnt
/bin/chmog 0755 root root /mnt
The existing /coherent kernel on the root file system will now be renamed to
coh.B4.420. After this the remainder of diskette #1 will be copied.

You have installed the COHERENT operating system onto your hard disk.
To install files from the remaining diskettes in the installation kit,
you must boot the COHERENT system from the hard disk.  It will prompt
you to install the remaining diskettes in the installation kit.
After you finish reading this information, remove the floppy disk.
If you type a partition number (0 to 7) while
the boot procedure is trying to read the floppy disk,
your system will boot the operating system on that partition.
If you type nothing, your system will boot 
COHERENT (partition %d).
active partition %d
 (%s)
You must boot the new COHERENT root filesystem on partition %d.
Now remove the floppy disk so your system does not boot from the floppy.
You MUST type %d when the system tries to read the floppy disk during the boot
procedure to boot the partition containing the new COHERENT root filesystem.
The next part of the installation procedure will let you change the
partitions on your hard disk.  It will also let you enter any needed
changes regarding drive geometry.  Data on unchanged hard disk partitions
will not be changed.  However, data already on your hard disk may be
destroyed if you change the base or the size of a logical partition,
or if you change the order of the partition table entries.
If you need to back up existing data from the hard disk,
type <Ctrl-C> now to interrupt COHERENT installation; then reboot your
system and back up your hard disk data onto diskettes.
/etc/fdisk -csB
This installation procedure allows you to create one or more partitions
on your hard disk to contain the COHERENT system and its files.
Each disk drive may contain no more than four logical partitions.
If all four partitions on your disk are already in use, you will
have to overwrite at least one of them to install COHERENT.
If your disk uses fewer than four partitions and has enough unused space
for COHERENT (%d megabytes), you can install COHERENT into the unused space.
If you intend to install MS-DOS after installing COHERENT,
you must leave the first physical partition free for MS-DOS.
The next part of the installation procedure will let you change the
partitions on your hard disk.  Data on unchanged hard disk partitions
will not be changed.  However, data already on your hard disk may be
destroyed if you change the base or the size of a logical partition,
or if you change the order of the partition table entries.
If you need to back up existing data from the hard disk,
type <Ctrl-C> now to interrupt COHERENT installation; then reboot your
system and back up your hard disk data onto diskettes.
COHERENT initialization normally writes a new master bootstrap program onto
your hard disk.  The COHERENT master boot allows you to boot the operating
system on one selected disk partition (the active partition) automatically;
it also allows you to boot the operating system on any disk partition by
typing a key when you reboot.  Mark Williams strongly recommends that you
use the COHERENT master boot.  However, the COHERENT master boot may not
work with some operating systems (for example, Xenix) if you make the
COHERENT partition active; instead, leave the other partition (e.g. Xenix)
active and boot COHERENT by typing a key.  If you do not use the COHERENT
bootstrap, you must understand how to boot the COHERENT partition using your
existing bootstrap program.

You must specify one COHERENT partition as the root filesystem.
The root filesystem contains the files normally used by COHERENT.
The root filesystem should contain at least %d megabytes.
The COHERENT root filesystem must be on partition 0 through 7.
COHERENT partition %d is marked as active in the partition table.
If you choose it as the root, you can boot COHERENT automatically.
Which partition contains the COHERENT root filesystem?
Which partition do you want to be the root filesystem?
Enter a number between 0 and 7 which specifies a COHERENT partition.
Root partition has %d megabytes free - update needs about %d megabytes.
Your current COHERENT root filesystem may be too small to contain the
COHERENT 4.2.0 update along with the on-line manual pages and the on-line
dictionary.  If you wish to have the on-line dictionary installed, you
may need to do the following:
1) Exit from the update.
2) Boot from your existing COHERENT root partition.
3) Perform a full "backup" of ALL PARTITIONS on your hard disk
   include all of your existing programs, files, and any system
   files that you have modified using backup utilities "cpio",
   "ustar", or "tar".  If your hard disk includes partitions
   assigned to other operating systems, be sure to back these up also!
4) Perform a full installation of COHERENT 386 using the same disks
   supplied for the update.  Note that you will need to increase the
   size of the root partition, or you will need to select a different
   partition to contain the root filesystem.   Please refer to the
   chapter on installation found in the COHERENT 386 release notes.
Do you wish to abort the update
Insufficient disk space for update!
Partition %d contains only %.2f megabytes.

Most PC compatible computer systems use MFM, RLL, IDE, or ESDI disk
controllers and disk drives.  Others use SCSI disk drives.
Please indicate the type(s) of disk drive(s) used in your computer system.
If you are uncertain of the type, please select choice 1.
Are you using:
1.  AT-compatible hard drive controller (IDE/RLL/MFM/ESDI).
2.  SCSI hard drive controller.
3.  Both.

You must create an empty COHERENT filesystem on each COHERENT partition
before you can use it.  Creating an empty filesystem will destroy all
previously existing data on the partition.
WARNING: blank AT partition %d not scanned.
Non-IDE AT drive partitions should be scanned.
Partition %d (%s) already contains a COHERENT filesystem.
WARNING!!!
The installation process expects a NEW file system in the root partition.
If you are trying to update an existing COHERENT partition, you must run
the COHERENT update.  If you are trying to install again after a partial
or failed installation, a new root file system must be created again now.

Your system includes %d partition%s in addition to the root partition.
These partitions are usually mounted on directories in the COHERENT
root filesystem when the system goes into multiuser mode.
For example, one non-root partition might be mounted on
directory "/u", another on "/v", and so on.
You now may specify where you want each partition mounted.
Partition %d (%s):
Do you want %s mounted
Where do you want to mount it?
Type a directory name beginning with '/', such as "/u".
That name did not begin with '/'.
/usr
We do not recommend mounting over /usr.
If you want user home accounts in a separate partition, you can put
them all in /home, for example, and mount into that directory.
/mnt/%s
%s exists but is not a directory.
Directory %s already exists.
Are you sure you want %s mounted on %s
/bin/mkdir -r /mnt%s

Enter the partition number of your MS-DOS partition:
/bin/ln -f /mnt%s /mnt/dev/dos
Device name /dev/dos is now linked to %s for use as a mnemonic
device name.  You may use the "dos*" family of commands to transfer files
to and from the MS-DOS partition on your hard disk as well as MS-DOS floppies.

Welcome to the COHERENT operating system!
Your computer is now running COHERENT 386 from the floppy disk.
This program will update your existing COHERENT 4.0.x system to COHERENT 4.2.0.
Be sure to read the section on "Updating" in the COHERENT 386 Release
Notes prior to attempting this update!
Please be patient and read the instructions on the screen carefully.
This program will install COHERENT onto your hard disk.
If you are already running COHERENT on your hard disk, you must perform an
update rather than a full installation.  To do so, please REBOOT NOW and
follow the detailed update instructions in the COHERENT release notes supplied
with this release.
You can interrupt installation at any time by typing <Ctrl-C>;
then reboot and start the installation procedure again.
Please be patient and read the instructions on the screen carefully.
A card included with your distribution gives the serial number
of your copy of COHERENT.
Type in the serial number from the card:
Invalid serial number, please try again.
