Gents:

It occurred to me that the release notes should have a page in them
that asks the user what hardware he has, and leaves space for him to
write his reply.  This will help the user organize his information
before he begins installation, so he's not fumbling around or guessing.

The following gives my draft checklist.  I'd appreciate it if you'd look
it over for sins of omission and comission:
