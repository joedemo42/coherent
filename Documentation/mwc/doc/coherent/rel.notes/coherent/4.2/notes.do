Fred,

Stephen and I noted the following problems with the revised release
notes.

Jay

Copyright page --

These are not going to printed until the end of the month so they should
be copyright 1994.  Also isn't UNIX now a trademark of USL or Novel?

Page 1 --

1st bullet point. --  Change "SCO versions" to "UNIX System V versions."

6th bullet point. --  Do we want to include floppy tape here, or do we want to
mention in the release notes page 60 that it will not be available until
January. I have no idea what the true development schedule is.

Page 4 --

I think that the first sentence of the fourth paragraph which begins,
"First, this..." should be in bold.

Page 8 --

Caveat 1. -- What are the true minimum requirements.  RS and our sales lit
say 15 MB and 40 MB you say 20 MB and 50 MB.  I don't know, but we should be
consistent.

Page 11 --

1st and 2nd paragraphs in the beginning installation section -- Please
explain why someone should wait 30 seconds and why they should turn their
system on and then insert the boot disk.  People find these instructions
strange.

Page 22

The 2nd to last box from the bottom -- It talks about COMX and COMY.
is this correct?

Pages 23 and 24.

Would it be more clear to say "Virtual Consoles part 1 and Virtual Consoles
part 2 than Virtual Consoles continued?

Page 25

Second sentence below the bolded word build is the word "system" shouldn't
it be "software."  Also you do not discuss what happens if the user's system
has a coprocessor.

Page 40

Software for Coherent Section --

Instead of Acucobol why don't you use MBP
Visual Cobol which is our software catalog or Micro Focus Cobol which is a
much bigger name.

In the  2nd paragraph --

You need to give an example of how to append your
old phonebook (that was saved if you updated) to the new phonebook.

ie cat oldphonebook >> phonebook

In the fourth paragraph --

1. I think that it reads better if you change "gives some" to "consists of"

2. I think that it reads better if you change "source code for GNU C/C++"
 to "source code for the GNU C/C++ compiler."

3. Please add the following sentence to the end of the paragraph.
"Or you can order by calling 800-636-6700 or 708-291-6700."

X WIndows for Coherent section

Last Sentence -- Between the words Coherent and use please add the following
sentence. "Call us now at 800-636-6700 or 708-291-6700." "Also they should use
teh order form at the end of these release notes."  We don't know if the
catalog will continue to be in the package.

Introducing Coherent Section

Second line of 1st paragraph -- Change "the BBS' to "our BBS."

First line of 2nd paragraph -- Change "Every program" to "Most every program."

First line of 3rd paragraph -- Should "addressing" be changed to "address?"

Page 43

Second to last paragraph --

1. GNU Tools costs $49.95.
2. Add the line "Or you can order by calling 800-636-6700 or 708-291-6700" to
the end of this paragraph.

We also need a section describing the Coherent Club. 

he basic point that needs to be made is ha joining the club for $49.95 gives
Coherent users the chance for great savings off third party software
products such as WordPerfect resold by MWC, other Coherent products sold by
MWC, as well as discounts off of future Coherent updates and enhancements.
It costs $49.95 to join.  (Please put this in your words as I think it will
flow  better.)

Page 47 --

1. Flex Gen is the name of the product.  SINC is the name of the comapny.
2. Remove Software Innovations.
3. Syntactics is teh company's name.

Page 48

Remove XTREE it does not run properly under 4.2.

Page 50

1st sentence -- Change the word "some" to "many" and add "vendors that" after
the word third-party.

General Directions 2 -- Isn't SVR 3.2 the third choice and SVR 2 the last
choice?

General Directions 10 -- I think the console driver in the release
defaults to a 25 line console.

Page 54

Discussion on WordPerfect Office  -- You must note that you can't receive mail
in wrod perfect office because it expects either a version of smail
that we don't support or SCO's MMDF.

Order form

2nd sentence -- Please add the line "Or you can order by calling 800-636-6700
or 708-291-6700" to the end of the 1st paragraph.

You need prices for several more products and you need the club price as
well ie.
