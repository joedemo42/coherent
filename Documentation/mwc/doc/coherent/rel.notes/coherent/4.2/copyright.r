This manual was written under the COHERENT operating system, using the
MicroEMACS text editor.
Text formatting was performed by the
COHERENT edition of the \fBtroff\f(RS text formatter,
using its PostScript output function.
Page design was implemented with custom-written macros written in the
\fBtroff\f(RS text-formatting language and in PostScript.
Typesetting of this manual, from the table of contents
through the index, was performed by one script written in the COHERENT
Korn shell.
Ornaments are derived from the Golden Bible of Augsburg, and were
supplied in encapsulated PostScript form by BBL Typographic,
137 Narrow Neck Rd., Katoomba, NSW 2780, Australia.
Camera-ready copy was printed on a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIP printer
using the Pacific Page PostScript cartridge.
