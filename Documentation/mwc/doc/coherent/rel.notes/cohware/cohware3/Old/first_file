The first file you should copy from cohware is \fBunzip.tar.Z\FR. Because
many of the files contained on COHware volume 3 are \fIzip archives\fR,
you will need the \fBunzip\fR command contained in \fIunzip.tar.Z\fR.

Using the instructions in the \fBInstalling COHware Volume III\fR,
mount disk #3 (for COHware on 3.5" diskettes) or disk #4 (for COHware
on 5.25" diskettes) to the directory \fB/f0\fR.

Copy the file \fIunzip.tar.Z\fR to the /tmp directory:

.ce
cp /f0/file_utils/unzip.tar.Z /tmp

Change to the /tmp directory, uncompress and untar \fIunzip.tar.Z\fR.
This will result in a new directory, /tmp/unzip being creates with the
source code and an executable command being placed in that directory.

Copy the unzip command to an appropriate directory:

.ce
cp /tmp/unzip/unzip /usr/bin

At this point you will now be able to extract files saved in a zip format.
