A filename of the form \fIname\fR\fB.zip\fR indicates that the file
is in a \fBzip\fR format. To extract files from a zip archive, use the
\fBunzip\fR command.

For example, to extract the contents of the archive \fIelm.zip\fR, use:

.ce
\fBunzip\fR -d elm.zip

Please note the \fI-d\fR option used with this command. It is essential
that this be used with all zip archives supplied with COHware volume 3.
