This manual was written under the COHERENT operating system, using the
MicroEMACS text editor.
Text formatting was performed by the
COHERENT edition of the \fBtroff\f(RS text formatter, generating PostScript.
Page design was implemented with custom-written macros written in the
\fBtroff\f(RS text-formatting language and in PostScript.
Capitals and ornaments are derived from the Paris Book of the Hours (1510),
and were supplied in encapsulated PostScript form by BBL Typographic,
137 Narrow Neck Rd., Katoomba, NSW 2780, Australia (bblart@peg.apc.org).
The key-caps font was supplied by SoftMaker, Inc., 2195 Faraday Avenue,
Suite A, Carlsbad, CA 92008.
Diagrams were drawn under the COHERENT implementation of X, using the
program \fBxfig\f(RS, which was originally written by Supoj Sutanthavibul
of the University of Texas at Austin.
Typesetting of this manual, from the table of contents
through the index, was executed by one script written in the COHERENT
Bourne shell.
Camera-ready copy was printed on a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIP printer
using the Pacific Page PostScript cartridge.
