.B checkalias
is part of the
.B elm
mailer system.
It checks
.BR elm 's
alias source files to see if each
.I alias
has been defined.
It first checks the user's alias file, then the system's alias file.
If it finds an alias, it prints its value;
otherwise it prints an error message.

Note that this command is in fact a one-line shell script:

.SH Notes
The precedence of user file over system file lets you ``overload'' an alias
by defining an alias in both files.
