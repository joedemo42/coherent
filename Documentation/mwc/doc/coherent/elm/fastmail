.B fastmail
is a low-level interface to the mail system.
It permits batch processing of mail.
With it, you can mail the contents of
.I messagefile
to every
.IR address .
If
.I messagefile
is `-',
.B fastmail
reads the standard input device for your message.
.PP
.B fastmail
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-b \fIbcc-list\fR"
Send a blind carbon-copy (BCC) to every
.IR address .
A ``blind'' carbon-copy is one in which the recipient is not named on
the message's carbon-copy line.
.IP "\fB\-c \fIcc-list\fR"
Send a carbon copy (CC) to every
.IR address .
.IP \fB\-d\fR
Debug.
This will help you decypher obtuse error messages.
.IP "\fB\-f \fIfrom\fR"
Write
.I from
instead of your name on the message's
.B From:
line.
For example, consider account
.BR marian@lepanto.mwc.com ,
which is owned by user Marian Smith.
By default, the
.B From:
line in a message from that person reads:
.DM
	From: marian@lepanto.mwc.com (Marian Smith)
.DE
.IP
.II "Clinton, Hillary"
However, if that user invoked
.B fastmail
with the option
.DM
	-f "Hillary Clinton"
.DE
.IP
then the
.B From:
line in her message will read:
.DM
	From: marian@lepanto.mwc.com (Hillary Clinton)
.DE
.IP "\fB\-r \fIreplyto\fR"
This resembles the option
.BR \-f ,
except that it modifies the
.B Reply-To:
line of your message.
Use this if you want the replies to your message to go to
a user other than yourself.
.IP "\fB\-s \fIsubject\fR"
Use
.I subject
as the subject of the message.
.SH Example
Let's say we're user
.B big
on machine
.BR big-vax ,
and we have a shell script called
.B batch-mail
that contains the following lines:
.DM
	#
	# Batch Mail - batch mailing of a file to a LOT of users
	#  
	# Usage: batch-mail "from" "subject" filename
.DE
.DM
	sender_copy = $LOGIN
	replto = "The-Mr-Big-list"
.DE
.DM
	fastmail -b $sender_copy -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person1
	sleep 10
	fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person2
	sleep 10
	fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person3
	sleep 10
	fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person4
		...
.DE
.PP
The command:
.DM
	batch-mail "Mr. Big" "Warning to all" warning.text
.DE
.PP
mails a copy of file
.B warning.text
to
.BR person1 ,
.BR person2 , 
.BR person3 ,
and so on.
User
.B $LOGIN
also silently receives a copy of the first message in the mail.
.B fastmail
places the following header on each message:
.DM
	From: big-vax!big (Mr. Big)
	Subject: Warning to all
	Reply-To: The-Mr-Big-list
.DE
.PP
This program should be considerably faster
than the alternative methods of accomplishing this task.
