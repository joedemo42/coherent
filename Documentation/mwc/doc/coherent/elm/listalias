.B listalias [ \fIregular-expression\^\fB ]\fR
.PP
The command
.B listalias
reads the user's and the system's alias files,
as set for the mailer
.BR elm .
It outputs one line of text per alias.
Each line of output is of the form:
.DM
	alias     address  (comment)
.DE
.PP
The aliases are sorted alphabetically.
.PP
If you use a
.I regular-expression
on the command line,
.B listalias
displays only those aliases that match the expression.

.SH Notes
Because
.B listalias
uses a pipe to the command
.BR egrep ,
how expressions are evaluated is depends upon that program.
.PP
.B listalias
recognizes only the alias files used with the mailer
.BR elm .
It does not ``grok'' the alias files used by other programs, in particular
those used by the mail-management program
.BR smail .
Therefore, its usefulness is rather limited.
