.SH Options:
.IC \fB\-h\fR
Display a help message
.IC \fB\-n\fR
Number the messages
.IC \fB\-q\fR
Quiet mode
.IC \fB\-Q\fR

.HE
.B frm
outputs one line per message of the form:
.DS
.I
	from
	subject
.R
.DE
.PP
where
.I from
names the person who sent the message, and
.I subject
is the subject of the message, should it contain one.
If the message is from you,
the
.I from
portion reads
.DS
	\fBTo \fIuser\fR
.DE
.PP
where
.I user
is the user to whom you sent the message.
This happens when you receive a copy of a letter you sent.
.PP
If you name a
.I folder
on the command line,
.B frm
reads that folder rather than your default mailbox
\fB/usr/spool/mail/\fIuser_id\fR.
If, however, you name a user on the command line,
.B frm
reads her mailbox, provided you have permission to read it.
.PP
.\"A folder can be specified with the same notation as
.\"when invoking the \fBElm\fR mailer (e.g., =folder).
.\".PP
.\"\fIFrm\fP invoked as \fInfrm\fP is identical to invoking ``frm -s new''.
.SH "Command-line Options"
.B frm
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-h\fR
Display a brief help message.
.IP \fB\-n\fR
Number the messages.
.B frm
uses the same numbering scheme that
.B readmsg
understands.
.IP \fB\-q\fR
Quiet mode:
Display only a one-line summary for each mailbox or folder specified.
.IP \fB\-Q\fR
Very quiet mode:
.B frm
displays only error messages.
This option is useful
in shell scripts,
where only the success or failure of the program is important
and output is not desired.
.IP \fB\-S\fR
Summarize the number of messages by message status in each mailbox or
folder.
If you want just a summary line, use this option with the option
.BR \-q .
.IP "\fB\-s \fIstatus\fR"
Display only headers from messages with
.IR status ,
which must be one of
.BR new ,
.BR unread ,
.BR old
(same as
.BR unread ),
or
.BR read .
Option
.B \-s
can be specified multiple times to print header information from,
for example, only new and unread messages.
It is sufficient to specify only the first letter of the status.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode.
Print a descriptive header before displaying
the contents of each mailbox or folder.
.SH Examples
The command
.DM
	frm
.DE
.PP
displays header information from all the messages in your mailbox, or the
message
.DM
	You have no mail.
.DE
.PP
should your mailbox be empty.
.PP
Command
.DM
	frm -s new
.DE
.PP
displays header information from all new messages in your mailbox,
or the message
.DM
	You have no new mail.
.DE
.PP
should you have no new mail in your mailbox
(i.e., no messages that arrived since you last read your mail).
.PP
The command
.DM
	frm -s new -s unread guest
.DE
.PP
prints header information from all new and unread messages in the mailbox for
user
.BR guest .
This assumes you have the permission to read
.BR guest 's
mail.
If
.BR guest 's
mailbox is empty,
.B frm
prints:
.DM
	guest has no mail.
.DE
.PP
Finally, the command
.DM
	frm -q -S
.DE
.PP
prints a one-line summary of how many new, unread, and read
messages are in your mailbox.
For example:
.DM
	You have 2 new messages, 3 unread messages, 23 read messages.

.B frm
returns the following value to the program that invoked it:
.IP \fB0\fR 0.3i
Messages that match
.I status
are present.
.IP \fB1\fR
Some messages are present, but none match
.IR status .
.IP \fB2\fR
No messages are present at all.
.IP \fB3\fR
An error occurred.
.PP
If you name
multiple mailboxes or folders on the command line,
the exit status applies only to the last one examined.
You can use this in a script to determine what kind of mail a user has.
