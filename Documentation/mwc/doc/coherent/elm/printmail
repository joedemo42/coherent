\fBprintmail [\-p] [\fIfilename\^\fB]\fR
.PP
The command
.B printmail
prepares the contents of a file or mailbox for printing.
It copies every message from either
.I filename
or your default mailbox, and inserts a line of dashes between messages.
In fact, this command is actually just a slightly differently
formatted call to the command
.BR readmsg .
.PP
The command-line option
.B \-p
tells
.B printmail
to insert between messages a formfeed character instead of a row of dashes.
This ensures that each message will be printed on its own page.
.PP
.B printmail
writes the formatted messages to the standard output, whence you can pipe
them to a pagination program or spooler.
For example, the command
.DM
	printmail | prps | lp
.DE
.PP
reads your mailbox and inserts dashes between messages; then pipes it to
.BR pr ,
which breaks it into pages and writes a header at the top of page; and
finally pipes it to the spooler
.B lp
for printing.
