.B answer
is a part of the 
.B elm
mail system.
It is designed to help users
transcribe telephone messages into electronic mail.
.PP
.B answer
uses standard mail addresses, and also reads the
alias files set in directory
.BR $HOME/.elm .
.B answer
can also use its own set of aliases; this usually is a subset of the
.B elm
system's aliases,
with more fields per user \(em e.g., unique first
names, unique last names, first-initial lastname, and so on.
If you wish to use this capability, you
must create this alias set, then use the command
.B newalias
install it as a separate alias table for the account from which
.B answer
is to be run.
.PP
.B answer
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-p\fR
Prompt for telephone slip\(emtype message fields.
.IP \fB\-u\fR
Allow names that are not in the alias table.
Without this option, every name must be resolvable as an alias, and
.B answer
prompts for a new name if it cannot resolve an alias.
.PP
.B answer
is very easy to use.
To invoke it, type
.BR answer .
It displays the prompt:
.DM
	Message to:
.DE
.PP
In reply, type the name or alias of the user to whom the message is to go.
Then fill in the requested information \(em if you are using the
.B \-p
option, simply type an `x' next to the pertinent information \(em
.BR TELEPHONED ,
.BR "PLEASE CALL" ,
.BR URGENT ,
and so on \(em and then type a message, if any.
Typing a blank line concludes the message.
.PP
If you elect to use the special alias file, 
you can enter a name as `Firstname Lastname'; the system
will try to find a mail alias based on the first letter of the
first name plus the last name.
For example, `Bill Clinton'
causes the program to search for an alias
.B b_clinton
in the file (note the transliteration into lower case).
.PP
.B answer
loops until it is killed or you quit.
To quit, type
.BR quit ,
.BR exit ,
.BR done , 
or
.B bye
at the
.B "Message to:"
prompt.
