Fred:

Long time, no chat!  I don't know if my reply to Scott Purkerson got 
out to the net, but I think there's an opportunity for documentation 
here.  :-)  

I think that your reply would make the basis of a good lexicon article
on the Xconfig file.  My reply contained a description of what hardware
books to consult for Clocks information, and a few words about how to
run the X386color -probeonly (remembering to comment out any existing
Clocks line).  Maybe that could get merged in as well.

Is this information in the newest X manual that comes with Coherent?

p.s. Thanks for the footnote in the new manual; one of my friends at
work showed ot to me.
