The X client
.B xmag
magnifies a portion of an X screen.
If its command line does not explicitly specify a region of the screen to
magnify,
.B xmag
lets you select interactively the portion of the screen to magnify.
It displays a square with the mouse cursor in its upper-left corner;
to select a portion of the screen, drag the square to the area that interests
you and click the left mouse button.
.PP
When you have selected a region to magnify,
.B xmag
pops up a window shows a magnified version of the selected region.
The following example shows the
.B xmag
window magnifying part of itself:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/xmag.eps
.PP
As you can see, the magnification represents
each pixel in the source image by a small square; on a color screen, the square
is the same color of the original pixel.
.\"Pressing Button1 in the enlargement window
.\"shows the position and RGB value
.\"of the pixel under the pointer until the button is released.
.\"Typing ``Q'' 
.\"or ``^C'' in the enlargement window exits the program.
.PP
At the top of the window,
.B xmag
displays the following six buttons:
.IP \fK(close)\fR
Close the
.B xmag
window.
.IP \fK(replace)\fR
Again display the selector square, so you can select a different portion of
the screen to magnify.
The newly selected portion replaces the portion displayed in the current
.B xmag
window.
You can select a portion of the
.B xmag
window itself, which in effect lets you ``zoom in'' on a portion of the screen.
.IP \fK(new)\fR
Again display the selector square, so you can select another portion of
the screen to magnify.
.B xmag
displays the newly selected portion in another
.B xmag
window.
.IP \fK(select)\fR
Cut the magnified image into the primary selection.
.IP \fK(paste)\fR
.II "primary selection"
Copy into the primary selection the display area of the current
.B xmag
window.
Note that you can cut and paste between
.B xmag
and the X client
.BR bitmap .
.PP
Resizing the
.B xmag
window resizes the magnification area.
.B xmag
preserves the color map, visual depth, and window depth of the source image
being magnified.
.SH Options
.B xmag
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR" 0.75i
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the client's window on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-fn \fIfont\fR"
Use
.I font
in the display.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the program's window to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the window and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mag \fIinteger\fR"
Use
.I integer
as the magnification factor.
The default is five.
.IP \fB\-rv\fR
Simulate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fB\-source \fIgeom\fR"
Set the size and location of the source region on the screen.
By default,
.B xmag
provides a 64\(mu64-pixel
square with which you can select an area of the screen.
.IP "\fB\-xrm \fIresourcestring\fR"
Use
.I resourcestring
to define a resource.
