.SH Options:
.IC \fB\-all\fR
Print information for all known widgets and objects
.IC "\fB\-format \fIprintf\-string\fR"
Use a \fBprintf()\fR-style format string to print the name,
instance, class, and type of each resource
.IC \fB\-nosuper\fR
Do not list resources that are inherited from a superclass
.IC "\fB\-top \fIname\fR"
.I name
gives the widget to be treated as the top of the hierarchy
.IC \fB\-variable\fR
Identify widgets by the names of the class-record variables
rather than by the class name given in the variable
.HE
.II "resource^list"
.B listres
generates a listing of a widget's resource data base.
The listing gives the class in which each resource is first defined,
the instance and class name, and the type of each resource.
.B listres
generates a listing for every widget named on its command line.
If the command line names no widgets, or includes the switch
.BR \-all ,
.B listres
generates a listing for every widget.
.PP
.B listres
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-all\fR 0.75i
Print information for all known widgets and objects. 
.IP "\fB\-format \fIprintf\-string\fR"
Use a \fBprintf()\fR-style format string to print the name,
instance, class, and type of each resource.
.IP \fB\-nosuper\fR
Do not list resources that are inherited from a superclass.
This is useful for determining which resources are new to a subclass.
.IP "\fB\-top \fIname\fR"
.I name
gives the widget to be treated as the top of the hierarchy.
Case is not significant, and
.I name
can match either the class variable name or the class name.
The default is
.BR core .
.IP \fB\-variable\fR
Identify widgets by the names of the class-record variables
rather than by the class name given in the variable.
This is useful for distinguishing subclasses
that have the same class name as their superclasses.
