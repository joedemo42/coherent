.B xlsfonts
lists the fonts that match the given \fIpattern\fR.
.I pattern
can contain the wildcard characters `*' and `?',
which match, respectively, any sequence of
characters (including none) and any single character.
If its command line gives no pattern,
.B xlsfonts
uses `*' by default.
Note that you must the `*' and `?' to protect them from
being expanded by the shell.
.SH "Options"
.B xlsfonts
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-1\fR
Listings should use a single column.
This is the same as
.BR "\-n 1" .
(Note that the character displayed here is the numeral one,
not a lower-case el.)
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\fB:\fIdpy\fR"
Contact display
.I dpy
on X server
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-l\^[\^l\^[\^l\^]\^]\fR"
Set the length of the listing for each font.
The options respectively request
medium-long, long, and very long listings.
(Note that the character displayed here is a lower-case el,
not the numeral one.)
.IP \fB\-m\fR
Long listings should also print the minimum and maximum bounds of each font.
.IP \fB\-C\fR
Listings should use multiple columns.
This is the same as
.BR "\-n 0" .
.IP \fB\-o\fR
Tell
.B xlsfonts
to perform an
.B OpenFont
(and
.BR QueryFont ,
if appropriate) rather than a
.BR ListFonts .
This is useful if
.B ListFonts
or
.B ListFontsWithInfo
fail to list a known font (as is the case with some scaled-font systems).
.IP "\fB\-n \fIcolumns\fR"
Use
.I columns
columns in the output.
By default,
.B xlsfonts
fits as many columns of font names as it can into the
number of characters specified by the option
.BR \-w .
.IP "\fB\-w \fIwidth\fR"
Give the width of the printout, in characters.
.B xlsfonts
uses this value to compute the number of columns to print.
The default is 79.
.IP \fB\-u\fR
Leave the output unsorted.
.SH Environment
.B xlsfonts
reads the environmental variable
.B DISPLAY
to find the host and display to use.
