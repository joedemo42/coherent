.B xclock
displays a clock that continually displays the current time.
This clock can either be analogue (that is, an old-fashioned
clock with hands) or digital.
The latter shows the hour and minute in 12-hour format; the latter
gives hours and minutes in 24-hour (military) format, plus the day, month,
and year.
The clock is initialized to the time on your system.
.PP
The standard clock is an analogue clock with a white background and black
foreground:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/xclock.eps
The following command-line options let you customize your clock:
.IP "\fB\-analog\fR" 0.75i
Display an analogue clock.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-chime\fR"
Chime (beep) once on the half hour and twice on the hour.
.IP "\fB\-digital\fR"
Display a digital clock that gives the date as well as the time.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the clock on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the clock to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the clock and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP "\fB\-hd \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the analogue clock's hands to
.IR color .
The default is black.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR"
Display a brief summary of
.BR xclock 's
syntax and options.
.IP "\fB\-hl \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the edge of the analogue clock's hands to
.IR color .
The default is black.
.IP "\fB\-padding \fIpixels\fR"
Set to
.I pixels
the padding between the window border and the edge of the clock.
The default is ten pixels for the digital clock, and eight for the analogue.
.IP "\fB\-rv\fR"
Simulate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fB\-update \fIseconds\fR"
Wait
.I seconds
before updating the time displayed on the clock.
The default is 60 seconds.
If set to less than 30 seconds, the analogue clock also displays a second hand.
.B xclock
automatically updates the time whenever the clock is iconified and then
re-exposed.
.IP "\fB\-xrm \fIresourcestring\fR"
Use
.I resourcestring
to define a resource.
.SH Resources
.B xclock
uses the Athena Clock widget.
It understands all of the core resource names as classes.
In addition, it understands the following:
.IP "\fBanalogue(\fRclass \fBBoolean)\fR"
Indicate whether to use an analogue clock.
The default is true.
.IP "\fBbackground(\fRclass \fBBackground)\fR"
Give the color of the foreground.
The default is white.
.IP "\fBchime(\fRclass \fBBoolean)\fR"
Indicate whether to chime on the hour and half-hour.
The default is false.
.IP "\fBfont(\fRclass \fBFont)\fR"
Give the font to use with the digital clock.
Variable-width fonts are not always displayed correctly.
.IP "\fBforeground(\fRclass \fBForeground)\fR"
Give the color of the foreground.
The default is white.
.IP "\fBhands(\fRclass \fBForeground)\fR"
Give the color of the inside of the analogue clock's hands.
The default is the foreground color.
.IP "\fBheight(\fRclass \fBHeight)\fR"
Give the height of the mailbox.
.IP "\fBhighlight(\fRclass \fBForeground)\fR"
Give the color used to highlight the analogue clock's hands.
The default is the foreground color.
.IP "\fBpadding(\fRclass \fBMargin)\fR"
Give the amount of padding, in pixels, to display between the border of the
window and the edge of the clock.
The default is eight.
.IP "\fBreverseVideo(\fRclass \fBReverseVideo)\fR"
Indicate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fBupdate(\fRclass \fBInterval)\fR"
The interval, in seconds, that
.B xclock
waits until it updates the time on the clock.
The default is 60 seconds.
Same as the option
.BR \-update .
.IP "\fBwidth(\fRclass \fBWidth)\fR"
Specify the width of the mailbox.

.SH Example
The command
.DM
	xclock -digital -update 1 -foreground red -chime
.DE
.PP
displays a digital clock that shows the current date and time in red
characters.
The clock is updated every second, and chimes on the hour and half-hour.
.SH Environment
.B xclock
reads the following environmental variables:
.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
The default host and display.
.IP \fBXENVIRONMENT\fR
The name of the resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the property
.BR RESOURCE_MANAGER .
