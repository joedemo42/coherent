.HE
.B xkill
commands the X server to close its connection to a client.
The severed client dies and its window vanishes from the screen.
The killed client does not clean up after itself,
so ``stuff'' may be left littering memory or the file system.
If used carelessly, this program can damage your system, but
it is useful for aborting programs that insist on displaying undesired
windows on your screen.
.PP
If you do not indicate the client to kill by using the
.B \-id
command-line option (described below),
.B xkill
displays a skull-and-crossbones cursor and
kills the client whose window you click with it.
.PP
.B xkill
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-all\fR"
Kill all clients with top-level windows on the screen.
.B xkill
asks you to confirm the killing by pressing one of the mouse buttons.
Do not use this option unless you absolutely must.
.IP "\fB\-button [\fInumber \fBany]\fR"
When
.I button
is pressed, kill the X client whose window is being clicked.
.B any
indicates that any button will do.
By default, the leftmost button does the trick.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Specify a resource on
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-frame\fR"
Ignore the standard conventions for finding top-level client windows
(which, typically, are nested inside a window-manager window), and instead
simply believe that you want to kill direct children of the root.
.IP "\fB\-id \fIresource\fR"
Kill the client whose resource has the identifier
.IR resource .
