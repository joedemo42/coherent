.B oclock
is an X client that displays an analogue clock on the screen:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/oclock.eps
The clock's time is set to the current system time, and is continually
updated to show the current time.
.PP
.B oclock
recognizes the following options:
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR" 0.75i
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the clock on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the clock to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the clock and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP "\fB\-hour \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the hour hand to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-jewel \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the ``jewel'' (the diamond-shaped spot that marks 12 o'clock)
to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-minute \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the minute hand to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-noshape\fR"
Forbid the clock to reshape itself.
.SH Colors
If you want your clock to be viewable in color, include the following in the
.B "#ifdef COLOR"
section you read with
.BR xrdb :
.DM
	*customization:                 -color
.DE
.PP
This causes
.B oclock
to pick up the colors in the color-customization file
.BR /usr/X11/lib/app-defaults/Clock-color .
Below are the default colors:
.DM
	Clock*Background: grey
	Clock*BorderColor: light blue
	Clock*hour: yellow
	Clock*jewel: yellow
	Clock*minute: yellow

.BR xclock ,
.B oclock
uses a round window.
