.B xgc
demonstrates features of the X graphics primitives.
By manipulating the mouse, clicking buttons, pressing mouse buttons,
and otherwise playing with the window, you can learn how these objects work.
.SH Options
.B xgc
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR" 0.75i
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the client's window on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-fn \fIfont\fR"
Use
.I font
in the display.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the program's window to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the window and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP \fB\-rv\fR
Simulate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fB\-xrm \fIresourcestring\fR"
Use
.I resourcestring
to define a resource.
.SH Environment
.B xgc
reads the following environmental variables:
.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
Find the default host and display number.
.IP \fBXENVIRONMENT\fR
Find the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the
.B RESOURCE_MANAGER
property.
