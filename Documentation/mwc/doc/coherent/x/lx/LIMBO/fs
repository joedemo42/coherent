.II "font server"
.II "X^font server"
.B fs
is the X Window System's font server.
It supplies fonts to X Window System display servers.
.PP
.B fs
usually is run by your system's administrator, and is started via file
.BR /etc/rc .
You may also wish to start a private font-server for a specific set of fonts.
.PP
.B fs
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-config \fIconfiguration_file\fR"
Run
.IR configuration_file .
.IP "\fB\-ls \fIlisten-socket\fR"
Use
.IR listen_socket .
This option is intended to be used only by the font server itself
when it spawns a copy of itself to handle additional connections.
.IP "\fB\-port \fItcp_port\fR"
Listen to
.I tcp_port
for connections.
.SH Signals
The following describes how
.B fs
responds to signals:
.IP \fBSIGTERM\fR
Exit cleanly.
.IP \fBSIGUSR1\fR
Re-read the configuration file.
.IP \fBSIGUSR2\fR
Flush all cached data.
.IP \fBSIGHUP\fR
Reset, closing all active connections, and re-read the configuration file.
.SH "Configuration"
When
.B fs
comes up, it reads a configuration file.
This file consists of a series of statements; each statement, in turn,
consists of a keyword followed by an equal sign `=' and one or values.
.PP
.B fs
recognizes the following keywords:
.IP "\fBcatalogue=\fIdirectory\^\fB[,\fIdirectory\^\fB, ... ]\fR"
Directories that
.B fs
searches for fonts.
Each
.I directory
must be a full path name.
Use of the keyword
.B catalogue
is very misleading at present, because as of this writing
.B fs
supports one catalogue (\fBall\fR) that contains all of the specified fonts.
.IP "\fBalternate-servers=\fIserver\^\fB[,\fIserver\^\fB, ... ]\fR"
Alternate servers for this font server.
.IP "\fBclient-limit=\fInumber\fR"
Support only
.I number
servers before refusing service.
This is useful for tuning the load on each font server.
.IP "\fBclone-self=\fIboolean\fR"
If
.I boolean
is set to
.BR on ,
.B fs
attempts to clone itself when it reaches the client-limit.
Setting
.I boolean
to
.B off
forbids this behavior.
.II decipoint^definition
.IP "\fBdefault-point-size=\fIdecipoints\fR"
Set the default point size, in decipoints.
A decipoint is one tenth of a printer's point, or 1/720th of an inch.
.IP "\fBdefault-resolutions=\fIresolution\^\fB[,\fIresolution\^\fB, ... ]\fR"
The resolutions the server supports by default.
.B fs
can this information as a hint for pre-rendering,
and can be substituted for scaled fonts that do not specify a resolution.
.IP "\fBerror-file=\fIstring\fR"
File name of into which
.B fs
logs all warnings and error messages.
.IP "\fBport=\fInumber\fR"
Listen to TCP port
.I number
for connections.
.IP "\fBuse-syslog=\fIboolean\fR"
When set to on,
.B fs
logs warnings and error messages.
Setting this keyword to
.B off
forbids this behavior.
.PP
The following gives an example configuration file:
.DM
	# allow a max of 10 clients to connect to this font server
	client-limit = 10
.DE
.DM
	# when a font server reaches its limit, start up a new one
	clone-self = on
.DE
.DM
	# alternate font servers for clients to use
	alternate-servers = hansen:7001,hansen:7002
.DE
.\".DM
.\"# where to look for fonts
.\"# the first is a set of Speedo outlines, the second is a set of 
.\"# misc bitmaps and the last is a set of 100dpi bitmaps.
.\"#
.\"#catalogue = /usr/lib/fonts/speedo,
.\"#	/usr/lib/X11/ncd/fonts/misc,
.\"#	/usr/lib/X11/ncd/fonts/100dpi/
.\"catalogue = all
.\".DE
.DM
	# in 12 points, decipoints
	default-point-size = 120
.DE
.DM
	# 100 x 100 and 75 x 75
	default-resolutions = 100,100,75,75

.SH "Font Server Names"
One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that
accepts TCP connections:
.DM
	tcp/\fIhostname:\fIport\fP
	tcp/\fIhostname:\fIport\fP/\fIcataloguelist\fP
.DE
.PP
.I hostname
specifies the name (or decimal numeric address)
of the machine on which the font server is running.
.I port
is the decimal TCP port to which the font server is listening for connections.
.I cataloguelist
specifies a list of catalogue names, with `+' as a separator.
For example:
.DM
	tcp/expo.lcs.mit.edu:7000
	tcp/18.30.0.212:7001/all
.DE
.PP
.\"One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that
.\"accepts DECnet connections:
.\".sp
.\".nf
.\"    decnet/\fInodename\fP::font$\fIobjname\fP
.\"    decnet/\fInodename\fP::font$\fIobjname\fP/\fIcataloguelist\fP
.\".fi
.\".PP
.\"The \fInodename\fP specifies the name (or decimal numeric address)
.\"of the machine on which the font server is running.
.\"The \fIobjname\fP is a normal, case-insensitive DECnet object name.
.\"The \fIcataloguelist\fP specifies a list of catalogue names,
.\"with '+' as a separator.
.\".PP
.\"Examples: \fIDECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT\fP, \fIdecnet/44.70::font$special/symbols\fP.
