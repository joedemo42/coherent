.II GIF
.B xgif
is an X11 program that displays GIF pictures on an eight-plane display.
.I filename
names the file or files to be displayed.
If no file is named on the command line,
.B xgif
reads the standard input.
.PP
.B xgif
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the client's window on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-e \fIexpansion\fR"
Expand the picture by
.IR expansion ,
which is an integer amount.
For example, viewing a 320\(mu200 picture with an expansion factor of
two results in a 640\(mu400 picture, each pixel of which is a 2\(mu2 block.
You may also expand the picture by using the
.BR \-geometry ,
described below,
to resize the window.
If you specify both the
.B \-e
and
.B \-geometry
options,
.B xgif
ignores the
.B \-e
option.
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-fn \fIfont\fR"
Use
.I font
in the display.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the program's window to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the window and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(miheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP \fB\-ns\fR
Turn off the auto-strip feature described below.
Use this to force
.B xgif
to use as many colors as possible.
The theory works like this:
if you have 256 unique colors in your GIF file, you will
probably be able to allocate all but a few of them.
Rather than stripping off
bits, which uniformly decreases the color resolution
for the whole picture, the
.B nostrip
option makes the program set the few unallocatable colors equal to
the closest colors that were allocated.
This may cause unsightly blotches on the picture; but then again, it may not.
.IP
This option is useful only on the first picture you try to display.
If you try to display more than one picture simultaneously,
the first picture will exhaust most of the color table,
leaving few no colors for subsequent pictures.
Therefore, succeeding pictures will be unsightly.
.IP \fB\-rv\fR
Simulate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fB\-s \fIstrip\fR"
Strip
.I strip
bits from the colors.
This lets you reduce uniformly the number of unique colors within a GIF file,
to help prevent exhausting the color map on your display.
You should never have to set this option, because the program automatically
invokes if it cannot allocate all of the required colors.
.IP "\fB\-xrm \fIresourcestring\fR"
Use
.I resourcestring
to define a resource.

.SH Notes
.B xgif
requires at least an eight-plane X11 display.
It ignores ``local colormaps'' in GIF files.
It also only displays the first image in GIF files that have multiple 
images in them.
The number of pictures you can display at once varies, depending upon
how many colors are in the GIF files and how many of them are
shared by other GIF files.
.PP
Note that a GIF file can be extremely large, depending upon its size and the
depth of its color map.
One megabyte is common, four megabytes not unheard of.
Whether
.B xgif
can display a file of that size depends entirely upon how much RAM you have
on your system:

.II "Naughton, Patrick J."
.B xgif
was written by John Bradley (bradley@cis.upenn.edu).
It is based on the program
.B gif2ras.c
by Patrick J. Naughton (naughton@wind.sun.com),
a program that converts GIF pictures to Sun Rasterfiles.
