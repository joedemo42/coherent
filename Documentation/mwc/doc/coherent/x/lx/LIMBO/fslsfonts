.IC "\fB\-n \fInumber\fR"
Display the output in
.I number
columns
.IC "\fB\-server \fIhost\^\fB:\fIport\fR"
Specify the server to contact
.IC \fB\-u\fR
Leave the output unsorted
.IC "\fB\-w \fIwidth\fR"
.I width

.HE
.II wildcards
.II "font^display"
.B fslsfonts
lists every font whose name matches \fIpattern\fR.
.II wildcards
A
.I pattern
can include the wildcard characters `*' and `?'.
(For more information on wildcards, see the entry for
.B wildcards
in the \*(CO Lexicon.)
If its command line includes no
.IR pattern ,
.B fslsfonts
uses `*'.
You must quote each `*' and `?' to stop the shell from expanding it.
.PP
.B fslsfonts
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-1\fR
Listings should use one column.
This is the same as \fB\-n 1\fP.
.IP \fB\-C\fR
Listings should use multiple columns.
This is the same as \fB\-n 0\fP.
.IP \fB\-l[l[l]]\fR
Generate medium, long, and very long listings, respectively,
for each font.
Note that the this character is a lower-case el, not a numeric one.
.IP \fB\-m\fR
Long listings should include the minimum and maximum bounds of each font.
.IP "\fB\-n \fInumber\fR"
Display the output in
.I number
columns.
By default,
.B fslsfonts
attempts to fit as many columns of font names as it can into the
width of output specified by option
.BR \-w .
.IP "\fB\-server \fIhost\^\fB:\fIport\fR"
Specify the server to contact.
.IP \fB\-u\fR
Leave the output unsorted.
.IP "\fB\-w \fIwidth\fR"
.I width
gives the width, in characters, of the output.
.B fslsfonts
uses this to figure out how many columns to print. 
The default width is 79 characters.
.SH Environment
.B fslsfonts
reads the environmental variable
.B FONTSERVER
to get the default host and port to use.

.SH Notes
The command
.B "fslsfonts \-l"
can tie up your server for a very long time.
This is a problem with single-threaded, non-preemptable servers,
not with this program.
