The script
.B x11perfcomp
tabulates the output of multiple runs of the command
.BR x11perf .
This lets you easily compare the performance of different servers,
or of the same server under various operating conditions.
.PP
Each
.I datafile
holds the output of a run of
.BR x11perf .
.I labelfile
holds labels that identify the tests that
.B x11perf
executed.
This file must precede any
.I datafile
which holds the output of an
.B X11perf
run.
To generate such a file, use
.BR x11perf 's
option
.BR \-label ,
as described in its Lexicon entry.
.PP
.B x11perfcomp
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-r\fR 0.3i
Include relative rates in the output.
.IP \fB\-ro\fR
Report only relative rates.
.IP "\fB\-l \fIlabelfile\fR"
Use
.I labelfile
as the label file.
The default is to use the first file named on the command line.
