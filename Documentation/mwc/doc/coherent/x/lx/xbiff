.HE
The X client
.B xbiff
automatically notifies you when you have mail.
It displays the following picture of an old-fashioned mailbox:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/xbiff.eps
When you do not have mail, the mailbox's ``flag'' is down;
when new mail arrives, the ``flag'' pops up, the image is redrawn in reverse
video, and the terminal beeps.
Clicking on the ``mailbox'' resets its ``flag'' to the down position and
redraws the image in normal video.
.SH Options
.B xbiff
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR" 0.75i
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Display the window on screen number
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to

.IP "\fB\-file \fImailfile\fR"
The user's mailbox file is
.IR mailfile .
.B xbiff
watches
.I mailfile
and pops its ``flag'' whenever
.IR mailfile 's
status changes.
By default,
.B xbiff
watches \fB/usr/spool/mail/\fIuser\fR, where
.I user
is the login identifier of the user who is running
.BR xbiff .
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the window to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the window and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP \fB\-help\fR
Print a brief message that describes
.B xbiff
and its options.
.IP \fB\-rv\fR
Simulate reverse video by swapping the foreground and background colors.
.IP \fB\-shape\fR
Shape the mailbox window, should masks for empty or full images be available.
.IP "\fBupdate \fIseconds\fR"
Wait
.I seconds
before checking the mailbox and, if necessary, updating the display.
The default is 60 seconds.
.IP "\fBvolume \fIpercent\fR"
Indicate how loudly
.B xbiff
should ring the bell when new mail arrived, as a percent of the terminal's
maximum volume.
The default is 33%.
.SH "Resources"
.B xbiff
has the application class name
.BR XBiff .
It uses the
.B Mailbox
widget in the X Toolkit.
It understands all of the core resource names and classes, plus the following:
.IP "\fBcheckCommand(\fRclass \fBCheckCommand)\fR"
Name a shell command to execute in order to check the status of the mailbox,
rather than checking the size of the mail file.
The command string is passed as an argument to the function
.B system()
(which is described in the \*(CO Lexicon), and so may contain redirection.
.B xbiff
assumes that a return value of zero indicates that new mail is waiting,
one indicates that there is no change in size, and two that mail has been
cleared.
.IP "\fBemptyPixmap(\fRclass \fBPixmap)\fR"
Name the bit map to display when no new mail is present.
.IP "\fBemptyPixmapMask(\fRclass \fBPixmapMask)\fR"
Name the mask for the bit map to display when no new mail is present.
.IP "\fBfile(\fRclass \fBFile)\fR"
Specify the name of the file to monitor.
Setting this option is the same as using the
.B \-file
option described above.
.IP "\fBflip(\fRclass \fBFlip)\fR"
Invert the image when new mail arrives.
The default is true.
.IP "\fBforeground(\fRclass \fBForeground)\fR"
Give the color of the foreground.
The default is white.
.IP "\fBfullPixmap(\fRclass \fBPixmap)\fR"
Name the bit map to display when mail arrives.
.IP "\fBfullPixmapMask(\fRclass \fBPixmapMask)\fR"
Name the mask for the bit map to display when mail arrives.
.IP "\fBheight(\fRclass \fBHeight)\fR"
Give the height of the mailbox.
.IP "\fBonceOnly(\fRclass \fBBoolean)\fR"
Ring the bell only once when new mail arrives.
Do not ring the bell when new mail arrives thereafter until at least
one interval has passed, the user has clicked on the mailbox, or read
his mail.
.IP "\fBreverseVideo(\fRclass \fBReverseVideo)\fR"
Invert the foreground and background colors to indicate reverse video.
The same as the option
.BR \-rt ,
described above.
.IP "\fBshapeWindow(\fRclass \fBShapeWindow)\fR"
Specify whether to shape the window to the
.B fullPixmapMask
and
.BR emptyPixmapMask .
The default is false.
Same as the option
.BR \-shape .
.IP "\fBupdate(\fRclass \fBInterval)\fR"
The interval, in seconds, that
.B xbiff
waits until it checks the mailbox.
The default is 60 seconds.
Same as the option
.BR \-update .
.IP "\fBvolume(\fRclass \fBVolume)\fR"
Specify how loudly the bell should be rung, as a percent of maximum volume.
The default is 33%.
This is the same as the option
.BR \-volume .
.IP "\fBwidth(\fRclass \fBWidth)\fR"
Specify the width of the mailbox.
.SH Actions
The Mailbox widget provides the following action for use in event translations:

reads the following environmental variables:
.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
The default host and display.
.IP \fBXENVIRONMENT\fR
The name of the resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the property
.BR RESOURCE_MANAGER .
