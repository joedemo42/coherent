.HE
.II VT-100
.B xvt
emulates the DEC VT-100 terminal under X.
It is a scaled-down version of the X client
.BR xterm :
it eschews some of that client's more esoteric features
to improve speed and reduce size.
Specifically,
.B xvt
does not implement the Tektronix 4014 emulation, session logging,
and toolkit-style configurability.
As a result,
.B xvt
uses much less memory than does
.B xterm
\(em a significant advantage on a machine with limited RAM.
.SH Options
.B xvt
recognizes the following command-line options.
With the exception of
.BR \-msg ,
these are a subset of those supported by
.BR xterm .
Most command-line options have X-resource equivalents;
these are listed in the following table.
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
For a list of recognized colors, see the file
.BR /usr/X11/lib/rgb.txt .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the background of the
.B xvt
window to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fInumber\fR"
Set the width of the window's border to \fInumber\fR pixels.
.\"Many window managers
.\"ignore existing window borders and construct their own and so, if you are
.\"using such a window manager, this option will be ignored.
.IP "\fB\-cc \fIcharacterclassrange\fB:\fIvalue\fB[,...]\fR"
Set or modify the characters that determine what is
a word when a double click is used to select a word of text.
This is identical to
.BR xterm 's
option
.BR \-cc .
For details, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR xterm .
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR"
Attempt to open the
.B xvt
window on
.IR display .
In the absence if this option,
.B xvt
uses the display specified by the environmental variable
.BR DISPLAY .
.IP "\fB\-e \fIcommand \fB[ \fIarguments\fB ]\fR"
Run
.I command
with its command-line
.I arguments
in the
.B xvt
window.
If this option is used, it must be the last on the command line.
If there is no \fB\-e\fR option then the default is to run the
program specified by environmental variable
.B SHELL
or failing that,
the Bourne shell
.BR sh .
This option also causes the window title and icon name
to be set to the name of the program being executed, if the are not
overwritten by a more specific option.
.IP "\fB\-fb \fIfontname\fR"
Set the font used for the VT-100 bold rendition.
Unlike
.BR xterm ,
.B xvt
will not try to create bold text by displacing and OR'ing
an ordinary font.
Therefore, if you want bold
highlighting to work, you must use this option to specify a suitable
bold font.
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the foreground of the
.B xvt
window to
.IR color .
.IP "\fB\-font \fIfontname\fR"
Set the main text font used by
.BR xvt .
For a list of recognized font names, see the files
.BR /usr/X11/lib/fonts/misc/fonts.alias
and
.BR /usr/X11/lib/fonts/75dpi/fonts.alias .
.IP "\fB-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Create the window with the specified X-window geometry.
.IP "\fB\-iconic\fR"
Start up with
.BR xvt
iconized.
.IP "\fB-msg\fR"
.II write
Enable messages to the terminal window from programs like
.BR write .
By default,
.B xvt
windows have messages disabled.
Executing an
.B xvt
with the
.B \-msg
option has the same effect as running it
normally and then executing the command
.B "mesg y"
to enable messages.
.IP "\fB-n \fIname\fR"
Set the name
.B xvt
displays in its icon.
This also sets the name that
.B xvt
shows in its title, unless you use the option
.BR \-title ,
described below.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR"
Obtain resources under
.I name
rather than as
.BR xvt .
.I name
should not contain the characters `.' or `*'.
.IP "\fB\-rw\fR"
Enable reverse wrapping of the text cursor.
This lets you edit shell commands that are longer than
the screen is wide.
.IP "\fB\-sb\fR"
Start up with the scrollbar visible.
The scrollbar can be displayed or
hidden at any time simply by holding down the
.B <ctrl>
key and clicking any mouse button.
Note that
.B xvt
saves text regardless of whether the scrollbar is displayed.
.IP "\fB\-sl \fInumber\fR"
Set the number of lines that
.B xterm
saves.
.IP "\fB\-title \fIname\fR"
.IS "\fB\-T \fIname\fR"
Set the name that
.B xvt
displays in its title bar
.SH "Resources"
With the exception of the options
.BR \-e ,
.BR \-display ,
and
.BR \-name ,
every command-line option has an X-resource counterpart.
Like
.BR xterm ,
.B xvt
uses the class name
.B XTerm
and so resource options set for
.B XTerm
also work for
.BR xvt .
The following table lists command-line options and their resource
counterparts:
.DS

.SH "Names, Titles, and Icon Names"
.II "window^names"
One occasionally confusing aspect of
.B xvt
and other X applications is the collection
of names that an application window can have, and the relationship
between the names and the command-line options used to set them.
This section attempts to make the situation a bit clearer in the case of
.BR xvt .
.PP
.II "resource name"
.II title
.II "icon^name"
.II window^title
.II name^window
Each terminal window has three names:
its
.IR "resource name" ,
its
.IR title ,
and its
.IR "icon name" .
These three names are distinct and have different functions,
although they usually have the same value.
The resource name names the command used to identify X resource options
in the resources data base.
The title is the text displayed in the title bar, if there is one.
The icon name is the name that appears in the window's icon
or represents it in the icon manager's window.
.PP
The options
.B \-name
and
.B \-e
set both the title and the icon name in addition to their main function.
Option
.B \-n
sets the title and the icon name.
Conflicts are
resolved by giving the options the following priorities:
first
.BR \-e ,
then
.BR \-name ,
.BR \-n ,
and finally
~.BR \-title .
Therefore,
.B \-e
sets the title only if none of the other options is used.
.SH "Scroll Bar"
.II scrollbar
.B xvt
saves the lines
of text that scroll off the top of its window,
up to a preset maximum.
You can view these lines by manipulating the
.B xvt
window's scrollbar.
To display or hide the scrollbar, press the
.B <ctrl>
key and click any mouse button.
.PP
When the scrollbar is displayed, click the left mouse button to roll up
a few lines; click the right mouse button to click down a few lines.
Assuming that
.B xvt
has buffered enough lines,
the distance scrolled with either button is equal to the
number of lines between the cursor and the top of the window.
Hence, pressing the left cursor opposite a line of text moves that line
to be the top of the window;
and pressing the right button moves the top line down
so that it is opposite the cursor.
.PP
To scroll continually, press move the mouse cursor to the scroll bar,
hold down the middle mouse button, and drag it up or down.
.SH "Cutting and Pasting Text"
.BR xvt ,
like
.BR xterm ,
lets you cut and paste text.
.PP
To paste text, move the mouse cursor to the spot where you want to
``drop'' the text, then press the middle mouse button.
(If your mouse has only two buttons, press both buttons simultaneously.)
.B xvt
will handle the pasted text just as if you had typed it from the keyboard.
.II cat
To drop text into a file, you can first invoke an editor, or use a command like
.BR cat .
.PP
To cut text, press the left mouse button at the point where you want to
begin cutting; drag the mouse to the end of the block of text you
wish to cut; and release the left mouse button.
.B xvt
highlights the text you have selected, to show that it is cut.
Cut text is copied into the X server's cut buffer and its primary selection
(that is, the property
.BR PRIMARY ).
.PP
To select a large block of text, click the left mouse button to begin
selection; then use the scrollbar to move lower in the file; and finally
click the right mouse button.
.PP
Double-clicking the left mouse button cuts the word that is under the mouse
cursor, with a ``word'' defined as a collection of ASCII characters
delineated by white space or newline characters.
Triple-clicking the left mouse button cuts the whole line.
word and a triple click selecting a whole line.  For this purpose,
a word is a sequence of characters in the same class.  The default
character classes are:
To change the character classes so that, for example, you
can select a \*(CO path name or a mail address in one double click,
use the option
.B \-cc
or modify the resource
.BR charClass .
You can combine multiple clicking and
dragging to select a sequence of consecutive words or lines.
.PP
Although
.B xvt
mimics the behavior of
.B xterm
in its support of text selection and insertion, there are a couple of
minor differences:
.IP \(bu
.B xvt
respects
.B <tab>
characters in selected text and does not automatically
convert them into spaces as
.B xterm
does.
.IP \(bu
.B xvt
lets you abort a text insertion if you realize
before you have released the middle mouse button
that you have made a mistake.
.SH "See Also"
.B
X clients,
xterm
.R
.SH "Notes"
In some instances,
.B xvt
does not permit you to backspace over a previously typed character and erase.
To work around this problem, you must issue the command
.DM
	stty erase ^H
.DE
.PP
If you use
.BR ksh ,
include this command in the file you name in the environmental variable
.BR ENV :
the Korn shell reads this file every time it spawns a sub-shell, and so will
configure your terminal device correctly.
For details on how to set and use
.BR ENV ,
see the Lexicon entries for
.B ksh
and
.BR .kshrc .
