.B xterm
is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
It opens a window that mimics either the DEC VT102 or the Tektronix 4014
terminals.
You can type text into this window, just as if you were at a terminal, and
so invoke X clients or utilities, or work with \*(CO commands
that do not use the X Window System directly.
.PP
When you resize the
.BR xterm 's
window,
it sends the signal
.B SIGWINCH
to notify any child \*(CO programs that the size of the window (in effect,
the size of the terminal) has changed.
Programs that understand that signal can then resize themselves to work with
the new window dimensions.
Note that as of this writing, most \*(CO applications do not yet
understand how to work with
.BR SIGWINCH .
.PP
The VT102 and Tektronix 4014 terminals
each has their own window so that you
can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the same time.
To maintain the correct aspect ratio (that is, height versus width),
Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect
ratio that will fit into the window.
This box is located in the upper left area of the window.
.PP
Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
considered the ``active'' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
output.
This is the window that contains the text cursor.
The active window can be chosen through escape sequences, through the menu
.B "VT Options"
in the VT102 window, or through the menu
.B "Tek Options"
in the 4014 window.
.SH Emulations
.BR xterm 's
emulation of the VT102 is fairly complete, but does not support the
blinking-character attribute nor the double-wide and double-size
character sets.
.B termcap
entries that work with
.B xterm
include
.BR xterm ,
.BR vt102 ,
.BR vt100 ,
and
.BR ansipc .
.B xterm
automatically searches the file
.B /etc/termcap
for these entries, and then sets the environmental variable
.BR TERM .
.\" and
.\" .BR TERMCAP .
You can modify many of
.BR xterm 's
special features (like logging) by typing a set of escape sequences different
from the standard VT102 escape sequences.  
.PP
.BR xterm 's
emulation of the Tektronix 4014 is also fairly good.
It supports four sizes of font and five types of line.
.B xterm
internally records all Tektronix text and graphics commands;
you can tell it write them into a file by sending it the escape sequence
.BR COPY ,
or through the
.B Tektronix
menu described below.
The name of the file will be
.DM
	COPY\fIyy\fP\-\fIMM\fL\-\fIdd\fL.\fIhh\fP:\fImm\fP:\fIss
.DE
.PP
where
.IR yy ,
.IR MM ,
.IR dd ,
.IR hh ,
.IR mm ,
and
.I ss
give, respectively,
the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second when
.B COPY
was executed.
.B xterm
the file into the directory from which
.B xterm
was launched, or the home directory for a login
.BR xterm .
.SH "Other Features"
.B xterm
automatically highlights the text cursor when the mouse cursor enters its
window, and un-highlights it when the mouse cursor exits the window.
If the
.B xterm
window is the screen's focus window, then the text cursor is
highlighted no matter where the mouse cursor is.
.PP
When it is running in VT102 mode,
.B xterm
has escape sequences to activate and deactivate an alternate screen buffer,
which is the same size as the display area of the window.
When this buffer is activated,
.B xterm
saves the current screen and replaces it with the alternate screen.
Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the
normal screen is restored.
The
.B termcap
entry for
.B xterm
allows the editor
.B vi
to switch to the alternate screen
for editing and to restore the screen on exit.
.PP
Both VT102 or Tektronix modes support
escape sequences to change the name of the windows.
.\"and to specify a new log file.
.\"Enabling the escape sequence to change the
.\"log file name is a compile-time option;
.\"by default this escape sequence is ignored for security reasons.
.SH Options
.B xterm
recognizes the following command-line options.
Prefixing an option with `+' instead of `-' returns the option to its
default value:
.IP \fB\-132\fR
Recognize the VT102 escape sequence
.BR DECCOLM ,
which switches between 80 and 132 columns, and resize the window appropriately.
By default,
.B xterm
ignores this escape sequence.
.IP \fB\-ah\fR
Always highlight the text cursor.
By default,
.B xterm
displays a hollow text cursor whenever the mouse cursor is not in the
.B xterm
window or its icon.
.IP \fB\-aw\fR
Allow auto-wraparound.
This feature lets the text cursor wrap automatically
to the beginning of the next line when when it is
at the end of a line and more text is output.
.IP \fB\+aw\fR
Do not allow auto-wraparound.
.IP "\fB\-b \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the inner border
(that is, the distance between the outer edge of the text
characters and the window's border) to
.IR pixels .
The default is two.
.IP "\fB\-bd \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the border to
.IR color .
The default is
.BR black .
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the background to
.IR color .
The default is
.BR white .
.IP "\fB\-bw \fIpixels\fR"
Set the width of the border to
.IR pixels .
.IP \fB\-C\fR
This window should receive text directed to
.BR /dev/console .
This is not supported on all systems.
To obtain console output, you must own the console device
and have read and write permissions for it.
.\"If you are running X under
.\".B xdm
.\"on the console device, you may need to have the session startup
.\"and reset programs explicitly change the
.\"ownership of the console device in order to get this option to work.
.IP \fB\-cb\fR
Set the
.B vt100
resource
.B cutToBeginningOfLine
to
.BR FALSE .
.IP \fB\+cb\fR
Set the
.B vt100
resource
.B cutToBeginningOfLine
to
.BR TRUE .
.IP "\fB\-cc \fIcharacterclassrange\fB:\fIvalue\fB[,...]\fR"
Use the classes indicated by the given ranges when selecting by words.
See the section on character classes, below.
.IP \fB\-cn\fR
Do not cut newlines in line-mode selections.
.IP \fB\+cn\fR
Cut newlines in line-mode selections.
.IP "\fB\-cr \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the text cursor to
.IR color .
The default is to use the same foreground color as that used for text.
.IP \fB\-cu\fR
Work around a bug in
.B curses
that causes \*(CO application
.B more
to drop the leading tab from a line that begins with a tab and is
preceded by a line that is exactly the width of the window.
.IP \fB\-cu\fR
Do not work around the above-described bug in
.BR curses .
.\" .IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
.\" Display the client's window on screen number
.\" .I screen
.\" of
.\" .I server
.\" on host system
.\" .IR host .
.IP "\fB\-e \fIprogram \fB[\fIargument \fB[, ... ] ]\fR"
Run
.I program
with each
.I argument
in an
.B xterm
window.
If the command line gives neither the option
.B \-T
nor the option
.BR \-n ,
.B xterm
sets the window title and icon name the base name of
.IR program .
\fIThis must be the last option on the command line.\fR
This option often is used to invoke
.B xterm
while running a shell other than your default shell.
.IP "\fB\-fb \fIfont\fR"
Display boldfaced text in
.IR font ,
which must the same height and width as the normal font.
If the command line specifies only the normal font or the boldface font,
.B xterm
uses that font as the normal font and produces boldface by overstriking it.
The default is to overstrike the normal font.
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Set the color of the foreground to
.IR color .
The default is
.BR black .
.IP "\fB\-fn \fIfont\fR"
Use
.I font
in the display.
The default is
.BR fixed .
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the program's window to
.IR geometry .
The term ``geometry'' means the dimensions of the window and its location
on the screen.
.I geometry
has the form \fIwidth\(muheight\(+-xoffset\(+-yoffset\fR.
.IP \fB\-help\fR
Print a message that describes these options.
.IP \fB\-iconic\fR
Begin the window as an icon rather than as a normal window.
.IP \fB\-im\fR
Turn on the resource
.BR useInsertMode .
.IP \fB+im\fR
Turn off the resource
.BR useInsertMode .
.IP \fB\-j\fR
Perform jump scrolling.
Normally,
.B xterm
scrolls text one line at a time; jump scrolling lets
.B xterm
scroll multiple lines at once, so it does not fall behind
the program that is writing text to the window.
This option makes
.B xterm
much faster when it scrolls through large amounts of text.
You can also use the VT100 escape sequences and the menu
.B "VT Options"
to turn feature on or off.
.IP \fB\+j\fR
Do not use jump scrolling.
.IP \fB\-l\fR
Write all terminal output into a log file as well as onto the screen.
You can also use the menu
.B "VT Options"
to enable or disable this option.
.IP \fB\+l\fR
Do not log what is written to the screen.
.IP "\fB\-lf \fIfile\fR"
Write text logged by the option
.B \-l
into
.IR file .
If
.I file
begins with a pipe symbol `|',
.B xterm
assumes that the rest of its command line is a shell command.
The default log file is named \fBXtermLog.\fIXXXXX\fR, where
.I XXXXX
is the process id of
.BR xterm .
By default, the log file is written into the directory from which
.B xterm
was launched; or in the case of a login window, into the user's home directory.
.IP \fB\-ls\fR
Let the shell that is started in the
.B xterm
window be a login shell (i.e., the first character of
.B argv[0]
will be a hyphen, which tells the shell to execute your
.BR .profile ).
.IP \fB+ls\fR
Do not let the shell that is started in the
.B xterm
window be a login shell.
.IP \fB\-mb\fR
Ring the bell when the user typing nears the right margin of a line,
as on an old-fashioned typewriter.
You can also turn this option on or off from the menu
.BR "VT Options" .
.IP \fB\+mb\fR
Do not ring the bell when the user's typing nears the margin.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mc \fImilliseconds\fR"
Set to
.I milliseconds
the maximum time between multi-click selections.
.IP "\fB\-ms \fIcolor\fR"
Set the mouse cursor to
.IR color .
The default is to use the foreground color.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR"
Obtain resources under
.I name
rather than the default, which is executable program's file name.
.I name
should not contain the characters `.' or `*'.
.IP "\fB\-nb \fInumber\fR"
Ring the bell when the text cursor is
.I number
characters from the right margin.
The default is ten.
This option is meaningful only if the option
.B \-mb
is also set.
.IP \fB\-rv\fR
Simulate reverse video by exchanging the foreground and background colors.
.IP "\fB\-rw\fR"
Allow reverse-wraparound.
This feature lets the test cursor
back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost
column of the previous line.
This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines, and its use is encouraged.
You can turn this option on or off from the menu
.BR "VT Options" .
.IP \fB+rw\fR
Do not allow reverse-wraparound.
.IP "\fB\-S\fIccn\fR"
Set the last two letters of the name of a pseudoterminal to use in slave mode,
plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.
The option is parsed \fB%c%c%d\fR.
This lets you use
.B xterm
as an input and output channel for an existing program.
.IP \fB\-s\fR
Let
.B xterm
scroll asynchronously.
This means that
.B xterm
does not have to keep the screen completely up to date as it scrolls.
This lets
.B xterm
run faster when network latencies are very high,
and typically is used when running across a very large network or
across many gateways.
.IP \fB+s\fR
Force
.B xterm
to scroll synchronously.
.IP \fB\-sb\fR
Permit
.B xterm
to save in a buffer a number of lines of text that have scrolled off the top of
the window, and display a scrollbar that lets you access those lines of text
interactively.
The command-line option
.B \-sl
sets the number of lines to save.
You can turn this option on or off from the menu
.BR "VT Options" .
.IP \fB\+sb\fR
Display a scrollbar for redisplaying old text.
.IP \fB\-sf\fR
Generate Sun Function Key escape codes for function keys.
.IP \fB\+sf\fR
Generate the standard escape codes for function keys.
.IP \fB\-si\fR
Output to a window does not automatically reposition
the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region.
You can turn this option on or off from the menu
.BR "VT Options" .
.IP \fB\+si\fR
Output to a window repositions the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region.
.IP \fB\-sk\fR
Pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review old text automatically
repositions the screen to the bottom of the scroll region.
.IP \fB\+sk\fR
Pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review old text does not
reposition the screen to the bottom of the scroll region.
.IP "\fB\-sl \fInumber\fR"
Buffer
.I number
lines that have scrolled off the top of the window.
The default is 64.
.IP \fB\-t\fR
Launch
.B xterm
in Tektronix mode rather than in VT102 mode.
You can use the menu
.B Options
to switch between the modes.
.IP \fB\+t\fR
Launch
.B xterm
in VT102 mode.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-title \fIstring\fR"
Display
.I string
in the title area of the window.
The default title is the command line specified after the command-line option
\fB\-e\fR, if any; otherwise, the application name is used.
.IP "\fB\-tm \fIcommand\^\fB=\fIkeystrokes\fB[,...]\fR"
Invoke internal terminal
.I command
with
.IR keystrokes ,
similar to settings of the \*(CO command
.BR stty .
.B xterm
recognizes the following commands:
.DS
.B
.ta 0.5i 1.5i 2.25i 3.0i
	intr	quit	erase	kill
	eof	eol	swtch	start
	stop	brk	susp	dsusp
	rprnt	flush	weras	lnext
.DE
.IP
You can specify a control charactger as \fB^\fIchar\fR
(e.g., \fB^c\fR or \fB^u\fR).
.IP "\fB\-tn \fIname\fR"
Name the terminal type to be set in the environmental variable
.BR TERM .
This terminal type must exist in the data bases
.B termcap
or
.BR terminfo ,
should include the entries
.B li#
and
.BR co# .
.IP \fB\-ut\fR
Tell
.B xterm
not to write a record into the system log file
.BR /etc/utmp .
.IP \fB\+ut\fR
Tell
.B xterm
to write a record into the system log file
.BR /etc/utmp .
.IP \fB\-vb\fR
Use a visual bell rather than an audible one.
When it reads the character
.BR <ctrl-G> ,
.B xterm
briefly redraws the screen in reverse video instead of ringing the bell.
Note that on the typical personal computer, this is rather slow.
.IP \fB\+vb\fR
Do not use a visual bell.
This is the default.
.IP \fB\-wf\fR
.B xterm
should wait for its window to be mapped for the first time
before it start any subprocess
(e.g., a shell or editor).
This helps ensure that that application's initial settings for
environment and terminal size are correct.
It is the application's responsibility to catch
subsequent changes to the terminal's size.
.IP \fB\+wf\fR
.B xterm
should not wait for its window to appear before it launches the subprocess.
.IP "\fB\-xrm \fIresourcestring\fR"

.SH Resources
In addition to all of the core X Toolkit resource names and
classes,
.B xterm
also understands the following resource names and classes:
.IP "\fBiconGeometry (\fRclass\fB IconGeometry)\fR"
Set the preferred size and position of the application when it is iconified.
It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
.IP "\fBiconName (\fRclass\fB IconName)\fR"
Set the name to appear on the icon.
The default is
.BR xterm .
.IP "\fBtermName (\fRclass\fB TermName)\fR"
Set the terminal type to be set into the environment variable
.BR TERM .
.IP "\fBtitle (\fRclass\fB Title)\fR"
Set the string that the window manager can used when it displays
this application.
.IP "\fBttyModes (\fRclass\fB TtyModes)\fR"
Set the string that contains the terminal-setting commands and key sequences
to which each is be bound.
Same as the command-line option
.BR \-tm ,
described above.
This is very useful for overriding the default terminal settings
without having to use the command
.B stty
every time you invoke
.BR xterm .
.IP "\fBuseInsertMode (\fRclass\fB UseInsertMode)\fR"
Force the use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the environmental
variable
.BR TERMCAP .
This is useful if your system's
.B termcap
entry for this type of terminal is broken.
The default is
.BR false .
.IP "\fButmpInhibit (\fRclass\fB UtmpInhibit)\fR"
Specify whether
.B xterm
should try to record the user's terminal in
.BR /etc/utmp .
.IP "\fBsunFunctionKeys (\fRclass\fB SunFunctionKeys)\fR"

.SH "Using the Mouse"
.II cutting
.II pasting
Once the VT102 window is created,
.B xterm
lets you cut text and paste it within the same or other windows.
.PP
The selection functions are invoked when the mouse buttons are used with no
modifiers, and when they are used with the
.B <shift>
key.
(If you wish, you can use the X utility
.B xrdb
to change what functions are linked to which keys and mouse buttons.
see the section entitled
.BR Actions ,
below.)
.PP
The left mouse button copies text into the X server's cut buffer.
Move the cursor to beginning of the text,
and then drag the mouse to the end of the region and release the button.
.II PRIMARY
.II property^PRIMARY
The selected text is highlighted, and is saved in the global cut buffer
(i.e., the property
.BR PRIMARY ).
.PP
Double-clicking cuts a word of text.
Triple-clicking cuts a line of text.
.\"Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.
Multiple-click is determined by the time from button-up to
button-down, so you can change the unit to be selected
while you are selecting.
If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made,
.B xterm
leaves the selected text highlighted for as long as
it owns the selection \(em that is, until you make another selection,
or click the right-mouse button to clear the selection.
.PP
The center-mouse button pastes the text from the primary selection,
if any; otherwise, it pastes the contents of the cut buffer.
Text being pasted is processed as though it were typed from the keyboard.
.PP
The right-mouse button extends the current selection.
By pressing this button and dragging the mouse, you can ``sweep'' out a mass
of text to cut.
.B xterm
displays all cut text in reverse video, so you can see exactly what you
have selected.
If you press the right mouse button while the mouse cursor is closer to
the right edge of the selection than the left,
.B xterm
extends/contracts the right edge of the selection.
If you contract the selection past the left edge of the selection,
.B xterm
assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original selection,
then extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.
Extension starts in the selection-unit mode
that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click
to cycle through them.
.PP
By cutting and pasting ``hunks'' of text without trailing new lines,
you can take text from several places in different windows and form a command
to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it into
your favorite editor.
Because the cut buffer is globally shared among different applications,
you should regard it as a ``file'' whose contents you know.
The terminal emulator and other text programs should treat it as if it
were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.
.PP
The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing
in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved.
As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area
decreases.
.PP
If you click the left mouse button when the pointer is in the scroll region,
.B xterm
moves the adjacent line to the top of the display window.
.PP
If you click the right mouse button,
.B xterm
drops the top line of the display window to the mouse cursor's position.
.PP
If you click the middle mouse button,
.B xterm
moves the display to a position in the saved text
that corresponds to the mouse cursor's position in the scrollbar.
.PP
Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not
allow you to copy text.
It does allow Tektronix
.B GIN
mode, and in this mode the mouse cursor changes from an arrow to a cross.
Pressing any key sends that key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.
Pressing the left, center, or right mouse buttons return the letters
`l', `m', and `r', respectively.
If the
.B <shift>
key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the corresponding
upper-case letter is sent.
To distinguish a mouse button from a key, the high bit of the character is
set (but this bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is
.BR RAW ;
for details, see the entry in the \*(CO Lexicon for
.BR stty ).
.SH Menus
.B xterm
has four menus, named
.BR mainMenu ,
.BR vtMenu ,
.BR fontMenu ,
and
.BR tekMenu .
Each menu pops up under the correct combinations of keystrokes
and mouse-button motions.
Most menus are divided into two sections, separated by a horizontal line.
The upper sections contains various modes that can be altered.
A check mark appears next to a mode that is currently active.
Clicking one of these modes toggles its state.
The lower section of the menu are command entries; selecting one of these
performs the indicated function.
.PP
An
.B xterm
menu pops up when you press the
.B <ctrl>
key and the left mouse button in a window.
The
.B MainMenu
contains items that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows.
Use the
.B "Secure Keyboard"
mode when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an
unsecure environment;
for details, see the section on security, below.
Notable entries in the command section of the menu are the
.BR Continue ,
.BR Suspend ,
.BR Interrupt ,
.BR Hangup ,
.BR Terminate ,
and
.BR Kill .
These send, respectively, the signals
.BR SIGCONT ,
.BR SIGTSTP ,
.BR SIGINT ,
.BR SIGHUP ,
.BR SIGTERM ,
and
.B SIGKILL
to the process group of the process running under
.B xterm
(usually the shell).
The function
.B Continue
is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed
.BR <ctrl-Z> ,
suspending the process.
.PP
The
.B vtMenu
sets various modes in the VT102 emulation, and is popped up when the
.B <ctrl>
key and right mouse button are pressed in the VT102 window.
In the command section of this menu, the soft-reset entry resets the
scroll regions.
This can be convenient when some program has left the scroll regions
set incorrectly (often a problem when using VMS or TOPS-20).
The full-reset entry clears the screen, resets tabs to every
eight columns, and resets the terminal modes (such as wrap and smooth scroll)
to their initial states just after
.B xterm
has finished processing the command-line options.
.PP
The
.B fontMenu
sets the font used in the VT102 window.
In addition to the default font and a number of alternatives that are
set with resources, the menu offers the font last specified by the
escape sequence
.B "Set Font"
and the current selection as a font name (if
.B xterm
owns the primary selection).
.PP
The
.B tekMenu
sets various modes in the Tektronix emulation.
It pops up when you press the
.B <ctrl>
key and the middle mouse button in the Tektronix window.
The current font size is checked in the modes section of the menu.
The
.B PAGE
entry in the command section clears the Tektronix window.
.SH Security
.II security
X environments differ in their security consciousness.
MIT servers, run under
.BR xdm ,
can use a ``magic cookie'' authorization
scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people.
If your server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to
the server (as described in the Lexicon entry for \fBxhost\fR),
then if you enable access for a host and
other users are also permitted to run clients on that same host,
there is every possibility that someone can run an application that will use the
basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities, possibly even
capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
This is of particular concern when you want to type in a password or other
sensitive data.
The best solution to this problem is to use a better
authorization mechanism than host-based control.
.PP
.B xterm
has a a simple 
mechanism to protect keyboard input.
The
.B xterm
menu (as described above) contains a \fBSecure Keyboard\fR
entry that, when enabled, uses the
.B GrabKeyboard
protocol request to ensures that all keyboard input is directed
.I only
to
.BR xterm .
When an application prompts you for a password
(or other sensitive data), you can use the menu to
enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fR,
type in the data, and then use the menu to disable \fBSecure Keyboard\fR.
.PP
Only one X client at a time can secure the keyboard,
so when you attempt to enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fR, it may fail.
In this case,
.B xterm
sounds the bell.
If the \fBSecure Keyboard\fR succeeds,
the foreground and background colors will be exchanged (as if you
selected the \fBReverse Video\fR entry in the \fBModes\fR menu);
they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode.
.II spoof
If the colors do
.I not
switch, then you should be
.I very
suspicious that you are being ``spoofed.''
If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for
the password, it is safest to enter secure mode
.I before
the prompt is displayed, and to make sure that the prompt is displayed
correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of spoofing.
You can also bring up the menu again and make sure that a check
mark appears next to the entry.
.PP
.B xterm
automatically disables
.B "Secure Keyboard"
mode if your
.B xterm
window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up
a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
around the window) while in
.B "Secure Keyboard"
mode.
(This is a feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)
When this happens,
.B xterm
switches back the foreground and background colors and sounds the bell.
.SH "Character Classes"
Clicking the middle mouse button twice rapidly selects all
characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation)
to be selected.
Because different people have different preferences for what should
be selected (for example, should file names be selected as a whole or only
the separate subnames), you can override
the default mapping through the use of the resource
.B charClass
(class \fBCharClass\fB)\fR.
.PP
This resource consists simply of a list of
\fIrange\fB:\fIvalue\fR pairs, where the
.I range
is either a single number or \fIlow\fB-\fIhigh\fR in the range of 0
to 127, corresponding to the ASCII code for the character or characters
to be set.
.I value
is arbitrary, although the default table uses the character number
of the first character occurring in the set.
.PP
The following gives the default table:
.DM
	static int charClass[128] = {
	/* NUL  SOH  STX  ETX  EOT  ENQ  ACK  BEL */
	    32,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,

.PP
For example, the string
.DM
	33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48
.DE
.PP
tells
.B xterm
to treat
the exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period,
slash, and ampersand characters as characters and numbers.
This is very useful 
for cutting and pasting e-mail addresses and file names.
.SH Actions
You can rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings for input
by changing the translations for the
.B vt100
or
.B tek4014
widgets.
Changing
the translations for events other than key and button events is not expected,
and can cause unpredictable behavior.
The following actions are provided for using within the
.B vt100
or
.B tek4014
\fBtranslations\fR resources:
.IP "\fBbell([\fIpercent\fR])\fR"
Ring the keyboard bell at the specified percentage
above or below the base volume.
