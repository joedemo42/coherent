.HE
The X utility
.B xrefresh
repaints all or part of your screen.
This is useful when
the screen has in some way become confused, e.g., by system messages.
It maps a window on top of the desired area of the screen, then immediately
unmaps it, which forces the X server to send refresh events to all applications.
.PP
By default,
.B xrefresh
uses a window with no background, which causes all applications to repaint
``smoothly.''
However, you can use various options instead a solid background
(of any color) or the root window's background.
.SH Options
.B xrefresh
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-black\fR
Use a black background \(em in effect, turn off all of the electron guns
within the tube.
This can be somewhat disorienting as the screen goes black for a moment.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIhost\^\fB[:\fIserver\^\fB][.\fIscreen\^\fB]\fR"
Refresh
.I screen
of
.I server
on host system
.IR host .
.IP \fB\-none\fR
This is the default.
.B xrefresh
repaints all windows.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Use the root window's background.
.IP "\fB\-solid \fIcolor\fR"
Use a solid background of
.IR color .
Try
.BR green .
.IP \fB\-white\fR
Use a white background.
The screen paints itself in white, then immediately repaints the root
window's background and all application windows.
.SH "X Defaults"
.B xrefresh
uses the routine 
.B XGetDefault()
to read defaults, so the names of all of its resourcs are capitalized:
.IP \fBBlack\fR
.IS \fBNone\fR
.IS \fBRoot\fR
.IS \fBSolid\fR
.IS \fBWhite\fR
Determine what to paint the window, before repainting the background and
applications' windows.
.IP \fBGeometry\fR
Determine the area to refresh.
This option is not very useful.
.SH Environment
.B xrefresh
reads the environmental variable
.B DISPLAY
to get host and display number.
