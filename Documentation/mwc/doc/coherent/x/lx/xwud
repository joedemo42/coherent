.SH Options:
.IC \fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR"
Specify the color to display for the `0' bits in the image
if a bit-mapped image (or a single plane of an image) is being displayed
.IC "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR"
Display the un-dumped image on
.I display
.IC "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Specify the color to display for the `1' bits in the image
if a bit-mapped image (or a single plane of an image) is being displayed
.IC "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Specify the size and position of the window
.IC "\fB\-help\fR"
Print a short description of these options
.IP "\fB\-in \fIfile\fR"
Read the image from
.I file
.IC "\fB\new\fR"
Create a new color map for displaying the image
.IC "\fB\-noclick\fR"
Do not terminate the program by clicking in its window
.IP "\fB\-plane \fInumber\fR"
Display a single bit plane of the image
.IP "\fB\-raw\fR"
Display the image with whatever color values
happen to exist on the screen
.IP "\fB\-rv\fR
Invert the meaning of each bit:
change every 0 into a 1, and vice versa
.IP "\fB\-std \fImaptype\fR"
Display the image using
.I maptype
as the standard color map
.IP "\fB\-vis \fIvis-type-or-id\fR"
Specify visual or visual class

The X client
.B xwud
un-dumps a window image that had been stored by the X client
.BR xwd .
.PP
.B xwud
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-bg \fIcolor\fR" 0.75i
Specify the color to display for the `0' bits in the image
if a bit-mapped image (or a single plane of an image) is being displayed.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR"
Display the un-dumped image on
.IR display .
.IP "\fB\-fg \fIcolor\fR"
Specify the color to display for the `1' bits in the image
if a bit-mapped image (or a single plane of an image) is being displayed.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR"
Specify the size and position of the window.
In most instances, you will want to specify only its position,
and let the size default to the actual size of the image.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR"
Print a short description of these options.
.IP "\fB\-in \fIfile\fR"
Read the image from
.IR file .
If its command line names no
.IR file ,
.B xwud
reads its input from the standard input.
.IP "\fB\new\fR"
Create a new color map for displaying the image.
If its image characteristics match those of the display, this option
can move the image onto the screen more quickly,
but at the cost of using a new
color map (which, on most displays, scrambles the colors on
the other windows).
.IP "\fB\-noclick\fR"
By default,
clicking any mouse button while the mouse cursor is within the window
terminates the application, and so erases the un-dumped image from the
screen.
This option turns off that behavior.
To terminate the program when it is in no-click mode, type
.BR q ,
.BR Q ,
or
.BR <ctrl-C> .
.IP "\fB\-plane \fInumber\fR"
Display a single bit plane of the image.
Bit planes are numbered, with zero being the least
significant bit; for example, a 256-color image consists of eight bit
planes, numbered 0 through 7.
You can use this option to figure out which plane to pass to
.B xpr
for printing.
.IP "\fB\-raw\fR"
Display the image with whatever color values
happen to exist on the screen.
This option is useful when
un-dumping an image onto the screen from which it was originally dumped,
while the original windows are still on the screen.
This helps move the image onto the screen more quickly.
.IP "\fB\-rv\fR
Invert the meaning of each bit:
change every 0 into a 1, and vice versa.
This option swaps the foreground and background
when displaying a bit-mapped image or a single plane of an image.
.IP "\fB\-std \fImaptype\fR"
Display the image using
.I maptype
as the standard color map.
The property name is obtained by converting the
type to upper case, and appending to it the prefix
.B RGB_
and the suffix
.BR _MAP .
Typical types are
.BR best ,
.BR default ,
and
.BR gray .
See the Lexicon's entry for
.B xstdcmap
for one way of creating a standard color maps.
.IP "\fB\-vis \fIvis-type-or-id\fR"
Specify visual or visual class.
The default is to pick the ``best'' one.
A particular class can be
specified, e.g.,
.BR StaticGray ,
.BR "GrayScale" ,
.BR "StaticColor" ,
.BR "PseudoColor" ,
.BR "DirectColor" ,
or
.BR "TrueColor" .
You can also specify
.BR "Match" ,
which tells
.B xwud
to use the same class as the source image.
Alternatively, an exact
visual identifier (specific to the server) can be specified,
either as a hexadecimal number (prefixed by ``0x'') or as a decimal number.
Finally, you can specify
.BR "default" ,
which tells
.B xwud
to use the same class as the color map of the root window.
Case is not significant in any of these strings.
.SH Environment
.B xwud
reads the environmental variable
.B DISPLAY
to find the display onto which it is to un-dump the image.
