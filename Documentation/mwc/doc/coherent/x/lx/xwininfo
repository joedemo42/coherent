.SH Options:
.IC "\fB\-all\fR"
Ask for all possible information
.IC \fB\-bits\fR
Display the attributes that pertain to the selected window's
raw bits and how the selected window is to be stored
.IC \fB\-children\fR
Print the identifiers of the select window's root, parent, and child windows
.IC "\fB\-display \fIserver\fR"
Connect to
.I server
.IC "\fB\-english\fR"
Display all individual height, width, and x and y positions
in inches (and feet, yards, and miles if necessary)
.IC \fB\-events\fR
Display the window's event masks
.IC "\fB\-frame\fR"
Include the window manager's frames when selecting a window manually
.IC "\fB\-help\fR"
Print a summary of this command
.IC "\fB\-id \fIid\fR"
Print information about the window with the identifier
.I id
.IC "\fB\-int\fR"
Display all window identifiers as decimal values
.IC "\fB\-metric\fR"
Display all individual height, width, and x and y positions
in millimeters, as well as number of pixels
.IC "\fB\-name \fIname\fR"
Print information about the window with name
.I name
.IC "\fB\-root\fR"
Print information about the X server's root window
.IC "\fB\-shape\fR"
Display the window's window and border shape extents
.IC "\fB\-size\fR"
Display the window's sizing hints
.IC \fB\-stats\fR
Display the attributes that pertain to the window's appearance and location
.IC \fB\-tree\fR
Like option
.BR \-children ,
but displays all children recursively, even unto the last generation
.IC "\fB\-wm\fR"
Display the window manager's hints
.HE
.B xwininfo
displays information about a window.
The information displayed depends upon the command-line options used.
If no options are used, it acts as if the
.B \-stats
were used.
.PP
You can select the target window either interactively
(by moving the mouse cursor into the desired window and then clicking
any mouse button), or by specifying it on the command line
with the options
.B \-id
or
.BR \-name .
.B xwininfo
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-all\fR" 0.75i
Ask for all possible information.
.IP \fB\-bits\fR
Display the attributes that pertain to the selected window's
raw bits and how the selected window is to be stored.
These include the selected window's bit gravity,
window gravity,
backing-store hint,
backing-planes value,
backing pixel,
and whether it has save-under set.
.IP \fB\-children\fR
Print the identifiers of the select window's root, parent, and child
windows.
.IP "\fB\-display \fIserver\fR"
Connect to
.IR server .
.IP "\fB\-english\fR"
Display all individual height, width, and X and Y positions
in inches (and feet, yards, rods, furlongs, and miles if necessary),
as well as number of pixels, based on what the server believes the resolution
to be.
Geometry specifications that are in the form \fB+x+y\fR are not changed.
.B \-metric
and
.B \-english
can be enabled simultaneously.
.IP \fB\-events\fR
Display the window's event masks.
This displays
both the event mask of events wanted by some client, and the event mask of
events not to propagate.
.IP "\fB\-frame\fR"
Include the window manager's frames when selecting a window manually.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR"
Print a summary of this command.
.IP "\fB\-id \fIid\fR"
Print information about the window with the identifier
.IR id .
This is useful when debugging an X application whose
window is not mapped to the screen, or when using the mouse might
be impossible or interfere with the application.
.IP "\fB\-int\fR"
Display all window identifiers as decimal values.
The default is to display them as hexadecimal values.
.IP "\fB\-metric\fR"
Display all individual height, width, and x and y positions
in millimeters, as well as number of pixels, based on what the
server believes the resolution to be.
Geometry specifications that are in the form \fB+x+y\fR are not changed.
.B \-metric
and
.B \-english
can be enabled simultaneously.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR"
Print information about the window with name
.IR name .
.IP "\fB\-root\fR"
Print information about the X server's root window.
This is useful when the root window is completely obscured.
.IP "\fB\-shape\fR"
Display the window's window and border shape extents.
.IP "\fB\-size\fR"
Display the window's sizing hints.
These include (for both the normal-size hints and the zoom-size hints)
the user-supplied location;
the program-supplied location;
the user-supplied size;
the program-supplied size;
the minimum size;
the maximum size;
the resize increments;
and the minimum and maximum aspect ratios.
.IP \fB\-stats\fR
Display the attributes that pertain to the window's appearance and location.
These include the location of the window,
its width and height,
its depth,
border width,
class,
color-map identifier (if any),
map state,
backing-store hint,
and location of the corners.
.IP \fB\-tree\fR
Like option
.BR \-children ,
but displays all children recursively, even unto the last generation.
.IP "\fB\-wm\fR"
Display the window manager's hints.
These can include whether the application accepts input;
what number and name of the the window's icon;
where the window's icon should go;
and what the window's initial state should be.

.SH Environment
.B xwininfo
reads the environmental variable
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

.SH Notes
The
.B \-geometry
string displayed must make assumptions about the window's border
width and the behavior of the application and the window manager.
As a result, the location given is not always correct.
