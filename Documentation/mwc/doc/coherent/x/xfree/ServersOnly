The following is a list of files/directories required when using a
cut-down source tree to build only the X servers.  When using this
cut-down tree, set BuildServersOnly to YES and XnestServer to NO in
xc/config/cf/xf86site.def.

To include PEX support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/PEX

To include XIE support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/XIE

Notes:

1. the Xnest server cannot be built with this cut-down tree since it
requires libX11.

2. Support for building a server with LBX support is not yet allowed for
with this cut-down source tree.
