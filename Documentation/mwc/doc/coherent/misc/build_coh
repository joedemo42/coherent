MAKING COHERENT O.S. DISKETTE SETS.
===================================
Mon Apr 18 18:57:35 1994 CDT
===================================

This document describes how to use scripts to generate a set of floppy
diskettes that will install or update the COHERENT operating system.

DISCLAIMERS:

1.  This version is just a rough draft.  I will test it and fill in more
    details when I have time after I get back from Albuquerque.  I am open
    to comments now, however.

2.  The kluge edits at the end of diskette one are a pain, and will cause
    serious headaches if you screw them up.  I started some m4 toys to
    eliminate them, but have not had time to finish.

===================================

1.  Directories in use.  The profiles take care of setting two key
environment variables used during the making of a distribution:

$a (usually /usr/adm/distrib) - this directory contains the scripts
used.  Its subdirectory, "divvy", contains information on which diskette
numbers contain which files - however, diskette #1 within this directory
refers to the *second* diskette of the set, not the first.

$n (usually /ndistrib) - this directory is the root of the image of the
COHERENT operating system that will be installed.  Also, directory
"$n/../ker" is where 3-1/2" and 5-1/4" kernel binaries are kept.

===================================

2.  Changes to the Distribution.

Since the files in the distribution tree will ultimately be sent to (we
hope) tens of thousands of customers, the following steps *must* be
followed exactly, without fail.

Generally, all changes to bits on $n should be made by me (hal).  In the
event that it seems reasonable for someone else to make a change to the
distribution bits, notify me, and *confirm* with me that I received the
notification.  Make a note of exactly what was done, why, and the date
when the change was made.  This must be done for change of permission,
deleting obsolete files, and adding new files as well as for simple file
updates.

When updating an existing file on $n, the following extra-conservative
procedure must be followed:

Sanity-test *all* changes to the distribution with at least one other
programmer.  No change is too trivial to cause major trouble.  It is
best to check with someone who has made several hundred distributions
already, such as Steve or me.

Suppose the file is /bin/foo, and you have a new version of /bin/foo on
floppy.

	/bin/mount f0 -r
	/bin/ls -l /f0/foo $n/bin/foo

	# Inspect ls output now to verify date information and
	# presence of the files in question.

	/bin/cp -d /f0/foo $n/bin/foo
	/bin/ls -l /f0/foo $n/bin/foo

	# Now $n/bin/foo should have new date and size matching /f0/foo, but
	# same permissions and ownership as old $n/bin/foo.

	/bin/umount f0

WARNING:  Do not edit files, run test programs, or otherwise horse
around with the distribution computer.  Doing so is a good way to
overwrite master files, or ship 40,000 copies of FOO to our customers.
Always make your file on another system, and copy it to the distribution
system.

===================================

3.  Making a Distribution.

Making a distribution on diskette is accomplished in two fairly lengthy
steps:  first, splitting the current set of bits among the destination
diskettes; and second, writing out the diskettes.  The main script,
"mkdist", is set up to do both steps, or just the second step if a
satisfactory split already exists.  Here are the steps in using mkdist:

If this is your first time, I recommend viewing the mkdist script, along
with splitdist, mkboot, squashdirs, and divvy (all in $a) before running
any of them.

1.  Make sure the contents of $n make a valid distribution, i.e., double
    check that any significant changes went into the right place (under
    $n, not under /), and that there are no temp files lying around in
    $n/tmp or $n/usr/tmp.
2.  Make sure there are two kernels of equal size and date in $n/../ker,
    one for 3-1/2" and another for 5-1/4".  In examples below, we will
    call them fva_kernel and fha_kernel.
3.  Save a .sym file from one of the kernels, say on a separate diskette,
    for future debugging.  Label and date the diskette.
4.  Format a set of diskettes for each size, preferably *not* using the
    distribution system, using
      /etc/fdformat -av -i 3 -o 13 /dev/rfha{01}
    (prepare 6 diskettes) for 5-1/4", and
      /etc/fdformat -av -i 3 -o 9 /dev/rfva{01}
    (prepare 5 diskettes) for 3-1/2" diskette.
5.  Log onto the distribution computer as root, and cd to $a.
6.  Type
      ./mkdist fva $n /tmp/fva $n/../ker/fva_kernel
7.  You will be asked if you want to make a new split, or use the existing
    one.  If anything in the kernel or in $n has changed, you must make a
    new split.  Making a new split adds about 25 minutes to the procedure.
8.  You will be asked for an id for the set, and a default, such as
    Coh_420 will be offered.  Hit enter to accept the default.
9.  The script may pause once or twice to display informative data on
    diskette space used, and number of diskettes needed.  You should probably
    write this down.  Note that divvy only counts diskettes after the boot
    disk.
10. After the distribution has been split, you will be prompted to insert
    your freshly formatted diskettes.  After the first diskette is written,
    there are four kluge edits that differ between formats.  The script
    opens up a vi session on the files in question.
    a.  Enter the correct number of diskettes, and the correct device name
        (fha/fva) in the /etc/install line of /etc/brc.install.
    b.  Enter the correct number of diskettes, and the correct device name
        (fha/fva) in the /etc/install line of /etc/brc.update.
    c.  Fix the DEFF0/DEFF1 lines in /bin for the proper format, i.e. if
        you are making a 3-1/2" distrib, DEFF0 is /dev/fva0 and DEFF1 is
        /dev/fha1; if you are making a 5-1/4" distrib, DEFF0 is /dev/fha0
        and DEFF1 is /dev/fva1.
    d.  Uncomment the appropriate #a/#a9/#b/#b9 lines in /etc/default/msdos.
        There are two sets of these at the bottom of the file, each clearly
        commented as to when it should be enabled.
11. Make the rest of the diskettes, without any more kluge edits.
