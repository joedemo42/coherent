This manual was written under the COHERENT operating system, using the
MicroEMACS text editor.  Text formatting was performed by the
COHERENT edition of the troff text formatter, generating PostScript.
Page design was implemented with custom-written macros written in the
troff text-formatting language and in PostScript. Diagrams were drawn under
the COHERENT implementation of the X Windows System, using the program
"xfig", which was originally written by Supoj Sutanthavibul of the University
of Texas at Austin.  Typesetting of this manual, from the table of contents
through the index, was executed by one script written in the COHERENT
Bourne shell.
