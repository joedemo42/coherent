This directory holds files from which the manual for Randy Wright's "cohulip"
program was built.  To rebuilt the manual, type "Run.troff" or "Run.nroff";
the former builds a printable version, the latter a version that can be
displayed on screen.

Directory "help" contains the help files included with cohulip.  Directory
"xfig" contains files output by xfig; these files hold the charts and
graphs used in the cohulip manual.  Note that the PostScript versions of
these are kept in directory /v/PostScript/manual.
