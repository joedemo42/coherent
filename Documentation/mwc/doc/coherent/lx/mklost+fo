.PP
When the command
.B fsck
checks your file system, it copies all ``orphaned'' files into directory
.B lost+found
in the root directory of the file system being checked.
Normally, this works well; however, if a great number of files are orphaned,
directory
.B lost+found
may not be able to hold them all.
This is because a directory is itself a file that holds information about
the files it contains; normally, \*(CO expands the size of a directory file
when it needs more space to hold files, but because
.B fsck
is forbidden to modify any file, it cannot enlarge
.BR lost+found .
Thus, orphaned files that cannot be copied into
.B lost+found
are deleted.
.PP
Script
.B mklost+found
lets you build an enlarged
.B lost+found
directory within
.IR directory .
It initializes the
.B lost+found
directory to be able to hold
.I slots
files.
If you do not specify how many files you want
.B lost+found
to be able to hold,
.B mklost+found
initializes it to hold 250 files.
.SH Example
The following command creates a
.B lost+found
directory that can hold 1,000 files for the file system that is mounted on
directory
.BR /news :
.DM
	/etc/mklost+found /news 1000
