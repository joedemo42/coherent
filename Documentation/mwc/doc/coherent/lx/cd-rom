.PC "COHERENT support for read-only compact disk devices"
.PP
The term
.I CD-ROM
stands for ``compact disk \(em read-only memory''.
\*(CO supports a variety of CD-ROM devices, from which you can read files
or play music.
.SH "Devices Supported"
As of this writing, \*(CO supports three varieties of CD-ROM drives:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
Sony CD-ROM models CDU31A or CDU33A, plugged its own dedicated controller.
.IP \(bu
Mitsumi CD-ROM models FX001, FX001 high speed, FX001D, or LU005, plugged into
its own dedicated controller.
Mitsumi model FX001 also is known to work when plugged into the
CD-ROM port of the SoundblasterPro sound card; the other Mitsumi drives have
not yet been tested with the Soundblaster Pro card.
.IP \(bu
Any SCSI CD-ROM drive plugged into an Adaptec 1542 SCSI controller.
.IP \(bu
Any SCSI CD-ROM drive plugged Seagate host adapter models ST01 or ST02.
.PP
Please note that the NEC SCSI CD-ROM is support for ISO file systems, but
.I not
for audio disks.
That is because the NEC drive does not use a standard interface for audio disks.
.PP
To use the driver for the Sony CDU31A drive, you must build a kernel that
contains the driver
.BR cdu31 .
Normally, this is done when you install or update \*(CO.
To add the driver to the kernel after installation or updating, do the
following:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
Log in as the superuser
.BR root .
.IP \(bu
.B cd
to directory
.BR /etc/conf .
.IP \(bu
Execute script
.BR cdu31/mkdev .
This script will walk you through the process of adding the driver to the
kernel.
If you are unsure of the answer to any question that the script asks you,
select the default; in most instances, this is correct.
.IP \(bu
Execute the command:
.DM
	/etc/conf/bin/idmkcoh -o coh.test
.DE
.IP
This builds a new kernel called
.BR coh.test .
.IP \(bu
Boot the new kernel, as described in the Lexicon entry
.BR booting .
.PP
To use the driver for the Mitsumi drive, you must build a kernel that
contains the driver
.BR mcd .
Normally, this is done when you install or update \*(CO.
To add the driver to the kernel after installation or updating, do the
following:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
Log in as the superuser
.BR root .
.IP \(bu
.B cd
to directory
.BR /etc/conf .
.IP \(bu
Execute script
.BR mcd/mkdev .
This script will walk you through the process of adding the driver to the
kernel.
If you are unsure of the answer to any question that the script asks you,
select the default; in most instances, this is correct.
.IP \(bu
Execute the command:
.DM
	/etc/conf/bin/idmkcoh -o coh.test
.DE
.IP
This builds a new kernel called
.BR coh.test .
.IP \(bu
Boot the new kernel, as described in the Lexicon entry
.BR booting .
.PP
If your CD-ROM drive is attached to an Adaptec 1542 SCSI controller,
you must modify the driver
.B hai
to support the drive.
Do so as follows:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
Log in as the superuser
.BR root .
.IP \(bu
.B cd
to directory
.BR /etc/conf .
.IP \(bu
Execute script
.BR hai/mkdev .
This script will walk you through the process of configuring
.B hai
to support your SCSI devices.
If you are already using
.B hai
to support a SCSI disk or SCSI tape, be sure that you do not alter how they
are configured.
If you are unsure of the answer to any question that the script asks you,
select the default; in most instances, this is correct.
.IP \(bu
Execute the command:
.DM
	/etc/conf/bin/idmkcoh -o coh.test
.DE
.IP
This builds a new kernel called
.BR coh.test .
.IP \(bu
Boot the new kernel, as described in the Lexicon entry
.BR booting .
.SH "Reading a CD-ROM"
\*(CO at present includes three commands for manipulating CD-ROMs:
.BR cdview ,
.BR cdv ,
and
.BR cdplayer .
.PP
.B cdplayer
lets you play audio CDs on your CD-ROM drive.
It uses a text-based interface to let
you display the contents of a CD, select a track, set the volume,
and otherwise manipulate your audio CDs.
.PP
.B cdv
is a script with which you can play CD-ROM disks \(em that is, disks that
hold an ISO-9660 file system.
The interface is character-based and rather crude; however, with it you
can read the contents of a directory on a CD-ROM, or copy a file from
the CD-ROM into a \*(CO directory.
.B cdview
is a lower-level command that is invoked through
.BR cdv .

.SH Notes
At present, you cannot mount an ISO-9660 file system onto your \*(CO system\fR.
A future release of \*(CO will permit you to do so.
.PP
.II "NEC/Toshiba"
.II "CD-ROM^NEC/Toshiba"
Please note that \*(CO, like most \*(UU-like operating systems, does not
support playing audio CDs on a NEC/Toshiba CD-ROM.
This is because NEC uses a non-standard interface for audio CDs.
