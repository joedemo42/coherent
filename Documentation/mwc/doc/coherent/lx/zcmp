If \fIfile1\fR is `-', use stdin.
If \fIskip1\fR and \fIskip2\fR are present, they are the number of bytes
to skip before comparing \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR, respectively.

.B zcmp
compares two compressed files in a byte-by-byte fashion.
It behaves exactly the same as
.BR cmp ,
except that it de-compresses compressed files ``on the fly.''
For details on the options to
.B zcmp
see the Lexicon entry for
.BR cmp .
