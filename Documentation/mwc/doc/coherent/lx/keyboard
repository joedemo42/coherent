\*(CO comes with two device drivers for the keyboard, as follows:
.DS
.ta 0.5i 2.0i
	\fBvtkb\fR	Non-configurable driver
	\fBvtnkb\fR	Configurable driver
.DE
.PP
.II "keyboard^alter driver"
To change the keyboard driver you are using, or to modify the behavior
of the driver
.BR vtnkb ,
log in as the superuser
.B root
and type:
.DM
	cd /etc/conf
	console/mkdev
.DE
.PP
The script
.B /etc/conf/console/mkdev
walks you through the process of configuring your console:
you can switch keyboard drivers from load to non-loadable (or vice-versa),
change the number of virtual consoles you use, or change the
keyboard-translation table you use by default.
.PP
Once you have configured the console, type the following command:
.DM
	bin/idmkcoh -o /\fIkernel_name\fR
.DE
.PP
where
.I kernel_name
is the what you wish to name the newly built kernel.
This builds a new kernel that incorporates the changes you requested.
To invoke these changes, simply reboot and invoke kernel
.I kernel_name
in the usual manner.
