.TH cc2 "" "" Definition
.PC
.PP
.B cc2
is the optimizer/object generator phase of the \*(CO C compiler.
It optimizes the code generated by
.BR cc1 ,
and writes the object code.
\*(PN uses multiple optimization algorithms.
One optimizes
jump sequences:
it eliminates common code, optimizes span-dependent
jumps, and removes jumps to jumps.
The other function scans the generated
code repeatedly to eliminate unnecessary
instructions.
