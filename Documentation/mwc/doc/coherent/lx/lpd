.TH lpd "" "" "System Administration"
.PC "Spooler daemon for line printer"
.B /usr/lib/lpd
.PP
.B lpd
is the daemon that prints listings queued by the command
.BR lpr .
All jobs are printed on the printer that is accessed through device
.BR /dev/lp .
For information on this device, and on printer management in general,
see the Lexicon entry
.BR printer .
.PP
.B lpr
invokes
.B lpd
automatically.
If there is no printing to do, or if another daemon is already running
(indicated by the file
.BR dpid ),
.B lpd
exits immediately.
Otherwise, it searches the spool directory
for control files of listings to print.
A control file contains the names of files to print,
the user name, banners, and files to be removed upon completion.
.PP
.B lpd
does not print listings in any particular order.
Priority is not given to any file, either by size or by requester.
