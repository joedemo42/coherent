statement:
if the condition described in the

statement fails, then the statements introduced by the
.B else
statement are executed.
For example,
.DM
	if (getchar() == EOF)
		exit(0);
	else
		dosomething();
.DE
.PP
exits if the user types \fBEOF\fR, but does something if the user
types anything else.
