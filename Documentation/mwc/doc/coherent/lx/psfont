The command
.B PSfont
``cooks'' a file that is in Adobe's downloadable-font format into
PostScript.
The output of
.B PSfont
can either be loaded into your PostScript printer as a memory-resident
font, which can be used across multiple files, or included within
the output of
.BR troff .
.PP
.B PSfont
recognizes two options:
.IP \fB\-q\fR
Quiet option:
suppress the printing of warning messages.
.B PSfont
normally complains about error conditions it finds within fonts, such as
extraneous control characters.
.IP \fB\-s\fR
Suppress the instructions
.B serverdict
and
.B exitserver
from the output.
Use this option if you wish to include the output of
.B PSfont
within
.B troff
output; do
.I not
use this option if you want the cooked font to be resident within the printer
after you download it.
.PP
.I infile
is the Adobe font file that
.B PSfont
cooks into PostScript.
It must have the suffix
.BR \&.pfb .
If you do not name an
.I infile
on the command line,
.B PSfont
reads the standard input.
.PP
.I outfile
names the file into which
.B PSfont
writes its output.
By convention, it should have the suffix
.BR \&.ps ,
although this is not required.
If you do not name an
.I outfile
on the command line,
.B PSfont
writes to the standard output.
