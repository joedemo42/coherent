.PC "Recover the modified version of a file after a crash"
\fBelvrec [\fIpreservedfile \fB[\fInewfile\^\fB]]\fR
.PP
Should
.B elvis
die while you were editing a file, it automatically invokes the command
.B elvprsv
to preserve the most recent version of your edited text.
.B elvprsv
stores the preserved text in a special directory:
it does
.I not
overwrite your text file
.PP
The command
.B elvrec
locates the preserved version of a file, and either overwrites your
text file or creates a new file, whichever you prefer.
The recovered file will hold nearly all of your changes.
.PP
To see a list of all recoverable files, run
.B elvrec
with no argument.
.I preservedfile
names the file into which
.B elvprsv
had saved the edited buffer.
.B elvrec
is very picky about file names:
you must use exactly the same path name as you did to edit the file.
.PP
.I newfile
names the file into which
.B elvrec
writes the edited buffer.
If you do not name a
.I newfile
on its command line,
.B elvrec
overwrites your original file with the preserved, edited version.
.SH Files
.IP \fB/usr/preserve/p*\fR
The text that was preserved when
.B elvis
died.
.IS \fB/usr/preserve/Index\fR
The names of all preserved files, and the names of the
files that preserve their text.
.SH "See Also"

.SH Notes
Due to the permissions on the directory
.BR /usr/preserve ,
only the superuser
.B root
can run
.BR elvrec .
.PP
If you haven't set up a directory for file preservation, then
you must manually run the program
.B elvprsv
instead of
.BR elvrec .
.PP
If you were editing a nameless buffer when
.B elvis
died, then
.B elvrec
saves the text into a file named
.BR foo .
