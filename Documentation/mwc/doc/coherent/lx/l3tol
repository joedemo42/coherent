To conserve space inside i-nodes in \*(CO file systems,
the system stores block addresses in three bytes.
Programs that reference or maintain file systems use the functions
.B l3tol()
and
.B ltol3()
routines to convert between the three-byte representation and
.B long
numbers.
.PP
.B l3tol()
converts
.I n
three-byte block addresses at location
.I l3p
to an array of
.B long
integers at location
.I lp.
