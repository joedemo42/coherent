.PC "Prepare a PCL font for downloading via MLP"
\fBpclfont [\-f \fIn\^\fB] \fIfont \fB[... \fIfont\^\fB]\fR
.PP
The command
.B pclfont
prepares each
.I font
for downloading via the MLP spooler
to a printer that runs the Hewlett-Packard Page Control Language (PCL).
.I font
must give the full path name of a PCL bitmapped ``soft font''.
.B pclfont
brackets each
.I font
with the PCL commands that tell the printer to load the
font into a given ``slot'' in its memory, and to let the font reside
permanently in memory, then writes the altered
.I font
to the standard output.
.PP
The option
.B \-f
names the slot into which you want to load
.IR font .
If the command line names more than
.IR font ,
.B pclfont
sequentially assigns slots beginning with slot
.IR n .
If you do not use the option
.BR \-f ,
.B pclfont
assigns slots beginning with slot 1.
.PP
The processed fonts can either be piped to the command
.B lp
or redirected into a file for later downloading.
When downloaded via
.BR lp ,
you must use the MLP device
.BR hpfont .
For example, to download fonts
.B tr240bpn.usp
and
.B op240bpn.usp
into slots 16 and 17 on your printer, use the command:
.DM
	pclfont -f 16 tr240bpn.usp op240bpn.usp | lp -dhpfont
