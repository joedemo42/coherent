.B uumvlog
copies all \*(UU log files into backup files, named for their respective
commands and the date upon which the backup was performed.
.I days
gives the number of days for which backup files should be kept:
if a backup file is more than
.I days
days old, then
.B uumvlog
will delete it.

This command should be run by
.BR cron ,
because the \*(UU log files can threaten to exhaust available file space
on a small system unless they are chopped back daily.

.SH Notes
.B uumvlog
manages the log files under directory
.BR /usr/spool/uucp/.Log .
However, it does not touch the files in
.BR /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin .
These can grow quite large if unattended.
At present, you must manage these files by hand.
