Function
.B nrand48()
generates a 48-bit random number, then
returns its high 31 bits in the form of a non-negative
.BR long .
The value returned is (or should be) uniformly distributed throughout the
range of zero through 2^31.
.I xsubi
is an array of three unsigned short integers from
which the pseudo-random number is built.
