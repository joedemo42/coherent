.II cdump
.B cdmp
dumps a file in COFF format into its most readable format.
Its default is to dump all information; but as this can produce
a very large output file,
.B cdmp
lets you use the following switches to mix-and-match its output:
.IP \fB\-a\fR
Suppress auxiliary symbol entries.
.IP \fB\-d\fR
Suppress data dumps
.IP \fB\-l\fR
Suppress line numbers.
.IP \fB\-r\fR
Suppress relocation entries.
.IP \fB\-s\fR
Suppress symbol entries.
.PP
.B cc
and
.B as
do not produce line numbers and auxiliary-symbol entries, and
.B ld
does not preserve them.
.PP
.B cdmp
writes its dump into the ``vertical hexadecimal format,''
like that produced by the function
.BR xdump() .
For example, the vertical hexadecimal dump of the string
``hello world.\en'' is:
.DM
   0 hell o wo rld. .
     6666.6276.7662.0
     85CC.F07F.2C4E.A
.DE
.PP
The hexadecimal value of `h' is 0x68,
which appears vertically under the `h'.
The dump is broken into groups of four bytes;
every unprintable character appears as `.'.
