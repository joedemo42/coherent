.II "kernel^STREAMS"
Beginning with release 4.2, \*(CO supports \*(ST.
This is a system that helps programmers create system-independent
device-drivers.
\*(ST replaces most of the kernel-accessible routines that are
unique to \*(CO.
.PP
For details on the \*(CO implementation of \*(ST, and for summaries
of the \*(ST routines, see the manual that comes with release 2.2
of the \*(CO Device-Driver Kit.
.PP
To add the \*(ST driver to your kernel (should it not already have it),
log in as the superuser
.B root
and then enter the following commands:
.DM
	cd /etc/conf
	streams/mkdev
	bin/idmkcoh -o /\fIkernel_name\fP
.DE
.PP
where
.I kernel_name
names the new kernel to build.
Then reboot to invoke the newly built
.IR kernel_name .
