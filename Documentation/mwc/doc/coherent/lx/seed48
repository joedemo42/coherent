Computation of 48-bit pseudo-random numbers uses two 48-bit integers
and one 16-bit integer.
One of the 48-bit values holds the ``seed'' value from which the
48-bit pseudo-random value is computed.
This seed can be set explicitly, or is the previously computed
pseudo-random number.
The other 48-bit integer holds the multiplier from which the pseudo-random
number is computed; and the 16-bit integer gives holds the addend.

Function
.B seed48()
initializes the ``seed'' from which a 48-bit pseudo-random number is computed.
.I param
is an array of three unsigned short integers that together comprise
the new 48-bit seed value.
.PP
.B seed48()
returns a pointer to an array of three unsigned short integers
that holds the old seed.
