The \*(PX is built upon the documentation for the \*(UN Operating System
published originally by AT&T Bell Laboratories (now by Unix Systems
Laboratories).
It defines a common set of guidelines to which \*(UN and \*(UN-like
operating systems like \*(CO should adhere in order to ensure common
functionality, and to maximize the portability of code from one operating
system to another.
The publication of the \*(PX is a long step towards maintaining the openness
of the \*(UN family of operating systems.
