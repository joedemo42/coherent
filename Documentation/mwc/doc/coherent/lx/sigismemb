.B sigismembeer()
is one of a set of signalling functions that manipulate
data objects addressable by the application, instead of a
set of signals known to the system.
It tests whether the signal
.I signo
is a member of the set of signals to which
.I set
points.
.PP
If
.I signo
is a member of
.IR set ,
.B sigismember()
returns zero.
If
.I signo
is set to an invalid or unsupported value,
it returns \-1 and sets
.B errno
to
.BR EINVAL .

If your program is compiled using the System V Release 4 compilation
environment, this is a function that is linked in from
.BR libc .
If not, a macro form is used.
