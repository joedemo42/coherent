.B lx
is a link to the command
.BR "ls \-x" .
It prints each
.I file
in columnar format, like the command
.BR lc ,
except that directories and file names are printed together in one listing.
If a
.I file
is a directory,
.B lx
lists its contents.
If no
.I file
is named,
.B lx
lists the contents of the current directory by default.
