ASCII.
When copying from \*(MD to \*(CO, convert the carriage-return/newline
combination to newline characters; when copying from \*(CO to \*(MD,
do the opposite.
.IC \fBk\fR
Keep the time stamp on copied files.
.IC \fBm\fR
Move.
Same as \fBa\fR, described above.
.IC \fBv\fR
Verbose.
Describe each action as it is executed.
.HE
.II "MS-DOS^copy directories"
.B doscpdir
copies a directory and its contents between an \*(MD file system and a
\*(CO file system.
The \*(MD file system can reside either on a floppy disk, or on
the \*(MD segment of a hard disk on your system.
.PP
.I src
names the directory being copied and the file system where it resides;
.I dest
names the file system and directory into which the file is copied.
The operating system that owns the
.I src
file is implied by the name of the file system on which it resides.
An \*(MD file system must be named using
the device that holds it,
such as floppy-disk drive
.B /dev/fha0
or hard-disk partition
.BR /dev/at0a .
You can also build a file of aliases so that
you can access the drives as
.BR a ,
.BR b ,
etc.
For details, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR doscp ,
which explains how to set up defaults for the \fBdos\fR family of commands.
.PP
.B doscpdir
converts a file's name from one operating system's conventions
to the other's.
An \*(MD file argument may be specified in
lower or upper case, using `/' as the path-name separator.
When transferring files from \*(MD to \*(CO,
.B doscpdir
converts an \*(MD file name to a \*(CO file name in lower case only.
If the \*(MD file name contains no extension, the \*(CO file name
contains no `.'.
When transferring files from \*(CO to \*(MD,
.B doscpdir
converts all alphabetic characters in a \*(CO file
name to upper case; if a period `.' appears at the beginning or
end of a file name,
.B doscpdir
converts it to `_'.
.B doscpdir
truncates the
part of the file name before the last `.' to a maximum of eight
characters and truncates the extension to a maximum of three
characters.
.PP
.B doscpdir
recognizes the following options:
.IP \fBa\fR
Perform ASCII newline conversion on file transfer.
When moving files from \*(CO to \*(MD, this option converts
each \*(CO newline character `\en' (ASCII LF) to an \*(MD
end-of-line (ASCII CR and LF).
When moving files from \*(MD
to \*(CO, it does the opposite.
By default,
.B doscpdir
performs ASCII conversion on files that have an ASCII extention.
.IP \fBk\fR
Keep:
give the copied file the same time stamp as its original.
By default,
.B doscpdir
gives copied files the current time.
.IP \fBm\fR
Same as \fBa\fR, described above
.IP \fBv\fR
Verbose.
Provide additional information about each action performed.
.SH Example
The following command copies \*(CO directory
.B /usr/src
to directory
.B /mydir
on the \*(MD file system.
It assumes that you have set
.B c
as a default for a hard-disk device:
.DM
	doscpdir -va /usr/src c:/mydir
.DE

.SH Notes
.B doscpdir
does not check for unusual characters in a \*(CO file name
or for file names that differ from other file names only in case.
.PP
.B doscpdir
does not understand compressed \*(MD file systems created by programs such as
.B Stacker
or \*(MD 6.0
.BR dblspace .
If you are running \*(MD with file compression,
you must copy files to an uncompressed file system
(for example, to an uncompressed floppy disk or to the uncompressed
host for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the
.BR doscpdir .
