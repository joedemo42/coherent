.B msqrt()
sets the multiple-precision integer (or \fBmint\fR) pointed to by
.I b
to the integral portion of the positive square root of
the \fBmint\fR pointed to by
.IR a .
It sets the \fBmint\fR pointed to by
.I r
to the remainder.
The value pointed to by
.I a
must not be negative.
The result of the operation is defined by the condition
.DS
	\fIa\fR = \fIb\fR * \fIb\fR + \fIr\fR.
