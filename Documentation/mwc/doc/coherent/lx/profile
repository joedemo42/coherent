.B /etc/profile
.PP
The shell executes the script
.B /etc/profile
whenever any user logs in.
This script sets up the default environment for a user.
Note that the actions of this script can be altered or supplemented
by each user's \fB.profile\fR script.
.PP
If
.B /etc/passwd
specifies a program in the login-shell slot, then
.B /etc/profile
is read by
.BR /bin/sh .
Those lines that begin with the command
.B export
are recognized as global environments,
and the remainder of the line is inserted into the environment.
.PP
Please note that if
.B /bin/sh
or
.B /bin/ksh
is not the shell, any constructions other than
.DM
	export foo=value
.DE
.PP
are not likely to work.
