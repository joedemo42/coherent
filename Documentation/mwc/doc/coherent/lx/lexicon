.PC "Format of the COHERENT manual pages"
.PP
The \*(CO manual pages use a unique format, which we call ``the Lexicon.''
Under this format, each function, each command, and each term has its
own entry in the manual.
All manual entries are printed together, instead of being divided
into segments.
The purpose of this format is to make it easy for you to find the manual
entry for any given command or function.
Anyone who as struggled with the multiple volumes of \*(UN documentation
can appreciate this feature of the \*(CO Lexicon.
.PP
For more details on the Lexicon format, see the introduction to the Lexicon.

.SH "Changes to the Lexicon"
The following summarizes the changes made to the Lexicon entries since
the manual was last printed.
These changes appear in on-line version of Lexicon, which you
can view with the command
.BR man .
.IP "Revised Articles"
The following articles have been heavily revised:
.RS
.IP \fBbackup\fR
This has been rewritten to cover tape backups.
.IP "\fBmail [overview]"
This article has been rewritten to reflect the fact that \*(CO release
4.2.14 uses release 3.1.28 of
.BR smail .
.IP \fBtape\fR
This has been rewritten to cover the \*(CO implementation of floppy tape.
.IP "\fBUUCP\fR"
This has been rewritten to reflect the fact that \*(CO 4.2.14 ships release
1.05 of the Taylor \*(UU package.
It gives a much fuller of the configuration tables and log files
that \*(UU uses, which will be helpful in debugging your \*(UU installation.
