Normally, a user can communicate with other
users by using the commands
.B msg
and
.BR write .

In certain situations, it is useful to suppress messages from other users.
Therefore, \*(CO supplies the command
.BR mesg ,
which, lets you permit or suppress messages from other users.
The argument

allows messages, whereas argument

disallows messages.
With no argument,

without changing the message state.
