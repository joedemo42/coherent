.B /etc/usrtime
.PP
.II /etc/usrtime
File
.B /etc/usrtime
holds the time, day of the week, and terminal line 
upon which a given user can log into your \*(CO system.
Command
.B login
reads it to see if a user who is attempting to log in is doing
at a permitted time and via a permitted line.
If a user is not named in this file,
.B login
assumes that she can log in at any time, via any line.
.PP
.B usrtime
consists of an indefinite number of lines, each with the following format:
.DS
	\fIusers\^\fB:\fIenable\^\fB:\fItty\^\fB:\fIweekday\^\fB:\fItime\^\fB:\fIcomment\fR
.DE
.PP
The following describes each field in detail.
.IP \fIuser\fR
The login identifiers of the user or users to be restricted.
Multiple identifiers must be separated by commas.
Each identifier must be defined in
.BR /etc/passwd .
If this field is empty, then the line is a default for every user
not specifically named elsewhere in
.BR usrtime .
.IP
The keywords
.BR ALL ,
.BR UUCP ,
.BR SLIP ,
and
.B INTERACTIVE
can also be used in this field, to name categories of users.
They are described in detail below.
.IP \fIenable\fR
Enable or disable the login (or logins).
.B NOLOGIN
disables the login;
.B LOGIN
or an empty field enables it.
A range of dates of the form
.DM
	yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd
.DE
.IP
enables logins only during those dates.
This field can contain more than one range of dates; if it does, the
ranges must be separated by a comma.
Prefixing a range of dates with a `!' disables logins between those dates.
.IP \fItty\fR
This field lists the devices via which the user (or users) may log in \(em
usually a
.B tty
or
.B com
device.
If this field names more than one device, they must be separated by commas.
A device name can contain the wildcard character `?'; for details on how
this is interpreted, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR wildcards .
If a device is prefixed with a `!', the user cannot log in on that device.
If this field is empty, then the user can log in on all devices.
.IP \fIweekday\fR
This field lists the days of the week upon which the the user (or users)
can log in.
If more than one day is named, they must be separated by commas.
Each day is identified by the first three letters of its name.
If a weekday is prefixed with a `!', then the users cannot log in on
that day.
If this field is empty, the users can log in on any day of the week.
.IP \fItime\fR
This field gives range of time during which the user (or users)
may log in.
Time is given in the form:
.DM
	hhmm-hhmm
.DE
.IP
If more than one range is named, they must be separated by commas.
Prefixing a range with a `!' forbids the user to log in during between those
times.
If this field is empty, then the user can log in during any time of the day.
.IP \fIcomment\fR
This field holds some commentary, presumably helpful to others who must
read this file.
.B login
ignores this field.
.SH "Scope of Entries"
A user may be affected by more than entry in this file.
The order in which the entries appear is significant.
.PP
At the top of the file should appear the entries that are being excluded
from restriction.
These should include such users as
.B bin
and
.BR daemon ,
plus any ordinary user you wish to exclude from being restricted.
The entries for such a users should consist of her (its) name,
followed by five colons.
Any user named in such an entry is immune to any restrictions that
may appear below in this file.
.PP
Next should come the global restrictions, that is, restrictions for
entire categories of users.
As mentioned above, you can use the keywords
.BR ALL ,
.BR UUCP ,
.BR SLIP ,
or
.B INTERACTIVE
to describe users.
These keywords have the following meaning:
.IP \fBALL\fR
All users.
.IS \fBUUCP\fR
All ``users'' who are UUCP accounts \(em i.e., whose shell as set in
.B /etc/passwd
is
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/uucico .
.IS \fBSLIP\fR
All ``users'' who are SLIP accounts \(em i.e., whose shell is
.BR sllogin .
.IS \fBINTERACTIVE\fR
Users who have an interactive the interactive shell
.B ksh
or
.B sh
set at login.
.PP
Last should come entries for individual users or clusters of users.
These restrictions can be set in addition to those set for categories
of users.
An entry for an individual users that appears below the global entries
will not loosen the restrictions set globally for that user; but it
can tighten them.
.PP
Note that
.B login
ignores any restrictions set for the superuser
.BR root .
Finally
.B login
ignores every line that begins with a `#'.
You can use such lines to hold comments.
