The command
.B alias
is used by the Korn shell
.B ksh
to set or display an alias.
.PP
When called without an argument,
.B alias
lists all aliases that have been set so far.
When called with a
.I name
argument alone, it lists alias of
.IR name ,
assuming one has been set.
.PP
When called with one or more arguments of the form
\fIname\fB=\fIvalue\fR, it established
.I name
as an alias for the command
.IR value .
For example, the command
.DM
	alias FOO="echo bar"
.DE
.PP
establishes the string
.B FOO
as an alias for the command
.BR "echo bar" .
Thereafter, when you type
.B FOO
on the shell's command line, it will execute the command
.B "echo bar"
and so echo the string \fBbar\fR on your terminal.
.PP
The Korn shell sets a number of aliases by default.
See the Lexicon entry for
.B ksh
for a list of these aliases and their settings.
