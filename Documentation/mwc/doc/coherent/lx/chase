.B chase
is a \*(CO version of a popular video game.
It runs on the console with input from the console keyboard.
.B chase
assumes that the system console is a monochrome display adapter unless you
select the
.B \-c
color-display option.
.PP
To accomodate different computer system speeds and different levels of skill,
.B chase
prompts the user to type a speed when the game begins.
Press
.B <return>
to try out the game with the default speed of ten;
typing a higher number makes the game slower,
a lower number makes it faster.
If you can play at speed zero on a fast computer system,
you play too many video games.
If you know the speed you want, you can enter it
as a command-line argument.
If you see the boss coming, quit by pressing
.BR <ctrl-C> .
.SH "The Rules"
The player (represented by a blinking shaded rectangle)
attempts to evade four ``ghosts''
(represented by shaded rectangles with arrows)
while erasing dots from the playing-board maze.
.PP
At the beginning of a game, the four ghosts are in the
.I "ghost box"
above the center of the maze
and the player is below it.
The maze is filled with dots, including four blinking diamonds called
.IR "power pellets" .
The ghosts emerge from the ghost box and chase the player.
The console arrow keys move the player left, right,
up, or down through the maze.
Typing `0' stops the player.
The player continues to move in the same direction until
a wall of the maze stops him, you type a `0', or you type
another arrow key.
.PP
When the player eats a power pellet,
he acquires super power and can chase the ghosts briefly;
the ghosts change color while the player has super power.
If the player catches a ghost, he scores a bonus and
the ghost returns to the ghost box temporarily.
Once a player eats all the dots on the board,
the game continues at the next level.
.PP
The upper left corner of the screen displays a score and the
current board level.
Each dot the player eats scores ten points.
The first ghost a player eats while he has super power scores
200 points, the second 400, the third 800, and
the fourth 1,600.
At certain times during the game, a bonus letter appears below the ghost box;
the player scores 100 points for eating the bonus letter on level `A',
300 on level `B', 500 on level `C', and so on.
.PP
The lower left corner of the screen displays the number of
extra players remaining in the current game (initally two).
Another bonus player appears every 10,000 points, to a maximum of three
extra players.
The game ends when the ghosts eat the last player.
