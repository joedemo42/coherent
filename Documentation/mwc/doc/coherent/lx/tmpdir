.TH TMPDIR "" "" "Environmental Variable"
.PC "Directory that holds temporary files"
.PP
The command
.B cc
reads the environmental variable
.B TMPDIR
to see where you want it to write its temporary files.
You can speed compilation by building a RAM disk and pointing
.B TMPDIR
to point at it.
.PP
For example,
if you have created a RAM disk and mounted it as \fB/z\fR,
then by embedding the instruction
.DM
	export TMPDIR=/z/tmp
.DE
.PP
in your \fB.profile\fR, you can ensure that \fBcc\fR will write all of its
temporary files onto the RAM disk.
