A
.B "manifest constant"
is a constant that is given a name
so it can be defined differently under different computing environments.
An example is
.BR EOF ,
the end-of-file marker, which has
wildly different representations under different operating systems.
Note, too, that numerals are manifest constants by definition.
.PP
The use of manifest constants in programs helps to ensure
that code is portable by
isolating the definition of these elements in a single header file,
where they need to be changed only once.
.PP
The header file
.B limits.h
defines a set of macros that express certain numeric
limits of \*(CO's implementation of C.
