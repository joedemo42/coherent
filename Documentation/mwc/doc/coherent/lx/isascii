.PP
.B isascii()
tests whether \fIc\fR is an ASCII character (0 <= \fIc\fR <= 0177).
It returns a number other than zero if \fIc\fR is an ASCII character,
and zero if it is not.
Many
.B ctype
macros fail if passed a non-ASCII value other than EOF.

For an example of how to use this function, see the entry for
