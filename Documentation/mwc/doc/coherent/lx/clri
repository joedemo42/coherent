.II "clear an i-node"
.B clri
zeroes out each i-node with
.I inumber
on
.IR filesystem .
.I filesystem
is almost always a device-special file
that corresponds to a disk device, e.g.,
.B /dev/rat0a
or
.BR /dev/rsd1c .
The raw device should be used.
For example, the command
.DM
	/etc/clri /dev/rat0a 8250
.DE
.PP
clears i-node 8250 on the file system on device
.BR /dev/rat0a ,
which is the first partition on your first AT hard disk.
.PP
The user must have read and write permission on the
.I filesystem.
If the file that
.I inumber
identifies is open, then
.B clri
probably will not work as you expect:
the system maintains in core memory a copy of all active i-nodes,
and the kernel will eventually write this copy to disk,
thus undoing the action of
.BR clri .
To ensure that this does not happen,
unmount the file system before you running
.BR clri .
If the i-node is for the root file system, reboot
the system immediately after you run
.BR clri .
