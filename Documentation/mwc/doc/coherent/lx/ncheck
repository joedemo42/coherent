.SH Options:
.IC \fB\-a\fR
Print file names including `.' and `..'
.IC "\fB\-i\fI n...\fR"
Print file names only for listed i-numbers \fIn...\fR
.IC \fB\-s\fR
Print only special files and files with setuid mode
.HE
An
.I i-number
identifies an i-node.
.B ncheck
generates a list of file names by i-number for each
.IR filesystem ,
which should be the name of a device special file that contains
a proper \*(CO file system.
Using the raw device generally decreases the time
.B ncheck
requires to do its work.
.PP
The output is in the unsorted traversal order of the file system hierarchy.
.B ncheck
distinguishes directories from files by suffixing \*(Ql/.\*(Qr
to directory names.
.PP
Under the
.B \-i
option,
.B ncheck
prints the file name corresponding to each i-number
.I number
in the given list.
Under the
.B \-a
option,
.B ncheck
prints only the names of special files and set user-ID mode files;
this option allows the system administrator
to ascertain quickly whether these files represent
possible security breaches.

.SH Diagnostics
.B ncheck
appends \*(Ql??\*(Qr to the generated file name if it cannot find the proper
parent structure while retrieving the file-name information.
It represents any loops detected in the file name by the characters
\*(Ql...\*(Qr.
Extremely addled file systems may generate other reasonably self-explanatory
diagnostics.
