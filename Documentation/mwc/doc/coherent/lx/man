\fBnroff \-man \fIfile ...\fR
.PP
.II tmac.an
The macro package
.B tmac.an
formats \*(UN-style manual pages.
To invoke this package, use the argument
.B \-man
with either
.B nroff
or
.BR troff
.PP
.B tmac.an
includes the following macros:
.nf
.sp \n(pDu
.ta 0.4i 
.IP "\fB.B [\fIstring ...\^\fB]\fR"
Use
.B boldface
font.
If used with one or more
.IR string s,
prints them in boldface.
Otherwise, print all subsequent text in boldface, up to the next
explicit change of font.
.IP "\fB.BI boldtext \fIitalictext \fBboldtext \fIitalictext ... \^\fB\fR"
This macro prints its arguments in alternating
.B boldface
and
.I italic
fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP "\fB.BR boldtext \fRromantext \fBboldtext \fRromantext ... \^\fB]\fR
This macro prints its arguments in alternating
.B boldface
and Roman fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP \fB.CO\fR
Print the string ``COHERENT''.
.IP \fB.DE\fR
End a display.
It is always used with the macro
.BR .DS ,
described below.
.IP \fB.DS\fR
Start a display.
The text that follows, up to the macro
.BR .DE ,
is read into a diversion.
It is not adjusted.
When the display is closed,
.B nroff
checks whether the present page has enough space left to hold the text.
If the page does not,
.B nroff
jumps to the next page and prints the text there.
.IP \fB.DT\fR
Set the default tab stops.
.B tmac.an
by default set a tab stop every five characters (half-inch). 
.IP \fB.HE\fR
Help end \(em close a section of help messages.
.IP \fB.HP\fR
Hanging paragraph.
The new paragraph is separated by a space from the text that came above it;
however, unlike the macro
.BR .PP ,
the new paragraph keeps the current level of indentation.
.IP \fB.HS\fR
Help start.
All text from here up to the macro
.B .HE
is assumed to form a special help message, and is ignored.
.IP "\fB.I [\fIstring ...\^\fB]\fR"
Use
.B italic
font.
If used with one or more
.IR string s,
prints them in italic.
Otherwise, print all subsequent text in italic, up to the next
explicit change of font.
.IP "\fB.IB \fIitalictext \fBboldtext \fIitalictext \fBboldtext ... \fR"
This macro prints its arguments in alternating
.I italic
and
.B boldface
fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP "\fB.IP [\fIstring \fB[\fIindentation\^\fB] ]\fR"
Indented paragraph.
If it has no arguments, it drops a space and indents subsequent text
to the current level of indentation.
If the macro has one argument, it uses that argument as a stub,
and indents the following text by another five characters (one-half inch).
If it has two arguments, it uses the first as a stub, and indents the
subsequent text by the value given in the second argument.
.IP "\fB.IR \fIitalictext \fRromantext \fIitalictext \fRromantext ... \^\fB]\fR
This macro prints its arguments in alternating
.I italic
and Roman fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP "\fB.PD [\fIdistance\^\fB]\fR
Set the default interparagraph distance to
.IR distance .
If invoked without an argument, it resets the interparagraph distance to
the default, which is kept in the number register
.BR PD .
.IP \fB.PP\fR
Paragraph.
The macro inserts a space into the output, and indent subsequent text by
the default amount, which is the value kept in the number register
.BR IN .
.IP \fB.R\fR
Use Roman font.
If used with one or more
.IR string s,
prints them in Roman.
Otherwise, print all subsequent text in Roman, up to the next
explicit change of font.
.IP "\fB.RB \fRromantext \fBboldtext \fRromantext \fBboldtext ... \fR"
This macro prints its arguments in alternating Roman and
.B boldface
fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP "\fB.RE\fR"
End relative indentation.
Subsequent text is printed at the previous level of indentation.
.IP "\fB.RI \fRromantext \fIitalictext \fRromantext \fIitalictext ... \^\fB\fR"
This macro prints its arguments in alternating Roman and
.I italic
fonts.
It takes up to six arguments.
.IP "\fB.RS [\fIindentation\^\fB]\fR"
Start relative indentation.
The indentation of subsequent text is increased by
.IR indentation .
If invoked without an argument, indentation is increased by the default amount,
as set by the number register
.BR IN .
.IP "\fB.SH [\fItext\^\fB]\fR"
Section heading.
Set
.I text
in bold as the title of the section.
If it is invoked without an argument,
this macro uses the first line of the subsequent text
as the section's title.
Subsequent text is indented by the default amount, as set by the number
register
.BR IN .
.IP "\fB.TH [\fIfirst second third fourth fifth\fB]\fR"
Header.
This is the first macro to appear in any manual page.
Its optional arguments are used in the header and footer of the manual
page, as follows:
.RS
.IP \fIfirst\fR
The name of the manual page.
It appears in the left and right corners of each page's header.
.IP \fIsecond\fR
This argument gives the section of the \*(UN manual that holds the
manual page.
.IP \fIthird\fR
This argument appears in the center of each page's footer.
It usually names the category of item that this manual page is documenting.
.IP \fBfourth\fR
This appears in the lower-left corner of each page.
.IP \fIfifth\fR
This appears in the center of each page's header.
.RE
.IP "\fB.TP [\fIindentation\^\fB]\fR"
Tagged paragraph.
This macro resembles the macro
.BR .IP ,
except that it uses first line of subsequent text as the paragraph's stub.
.PP
.B tmac.an
uses the following number registers to control its behavior.
These are defined in the macro
.BR .TH ;
if you wish to reset them, do so
.I after
you have invoked macro
.BR .TH :
.IP \fBIN\fR
The default indentation.
.IP \fBLL\fR
The default line length.
.IP \fBPD\fR
The default distance between paragraphs.
.PP
Finally,
.B tmac.an
sets the following strings:
.IP \fBR\fR
The registered trademark symbol.
This is equivalent to the special character \fB\e(rg\fR.
.IP \fBTm\fR
The trademark symbol.
This is equivalent to the special character \fB\e(tm\fR.
