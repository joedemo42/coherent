.II "file locking, UUCP"
\*(UU uses a system of lock files to ensure that sites are polled in an orderly
manner.
It creates a lock file named after the site being polled, to prevent more than
one invocation of
.B uucico
or another \*(UU command from polling the same site at the same time.
On occasion, if \*(UU fails or crashes, it will neglect to clean up its lock
files, thus preventing itself from polling the locked sites.
.PP
The command
.B uurmlock
removes all lock files.
You should run this if you suspect that \*(UU has died in a disorderly
manner and has left lock files lying around unattended.
.PP
Before you run
.BR uurmlock ,
examine the output of the command
.B ps
to ensure that no \*(UU command is running at the moment (and so has
legitimately locked a site).

.SH Notes
Only the superuser
.B root
can run
.BR uurmlock .
.PP
Note that
.B uurmlock
removes all
.B .LCK
files from
.BR /usr/spool/uucp .
Not all of these are used by UUCP; however, this behavior is necessary to
remain compatible with \*(UN, and is almost always benign.
