\fB/etc/getty \fItype\fR
.PP
The initialization process
.B init
invokes
.B getty
for each device indicated in the file
.BR /etc/ttys .
.B getty
tries to read a user name from the terminal which is the standard input,
adapting its mode settings accordingly.
Then
.B getty
invokes
.B login
with the name read.
This process may set delays, mapping of upper to lower case, speed,
and whether the terminal normally uses carriage return or linefeed
to terminate input.
.PP
If the terminal baud rate is wrong, the login message printed by
.B getty
will appear garbled.
If the specified
.I type
indicates variable speeds, as described below,
hitting BREAK will try the next speed.
.PP
.B init
passes the third character in a line of the file
.B /etc/ttys
as the
.I type
argument to
.BR getty .
.I type
conveys information about the terminal port.
An upper-case letter in the range
.B A
to
.B S
specifies a hard-wired baud rate, as indicated in the header file
.BR <sgtty.h> .
Other characters specify a range
of speeds suitable to a dial-in modem.
The following variable-speed settings are recognized:
.IP \fB0\fR 0.3i
Cycles through
speeds 300, 1200, 150, and 110 baud, in that order.
This is a good default setting for dial-in ports.
.IP \fB\-\fR
Teletype model 33, fixed at 110 baud.
.IP \fB1\fR
Teletype model 37, fixed at 150 baud.
.IP \fB2\fR
9600 baud with delays (e.g., Tektronix 4104).
.IP \fB3\fR
Cycles between 2400, 1200, and 300 baud.
This is used with 2400-bps modems.
.IP \fB4\fR
DECwriter (LA36) with delays.
.IP \fB5\fR
Like
.BR 3 ,
but starts at 300 baud.
.PP
.B getty
recognizes
the following fixed-speed settings, for hard-wired terminals:
.sp \n(pDu

	\fBA\fR	50 baud
