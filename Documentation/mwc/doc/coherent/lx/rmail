Command
.B rmail
receives and processes mail from remote sites.
It reads and interprets the address on the mail.
If the mail is addressed to a user on your local system, it hands the
mail to the local-mail deliverer
.B lmail
for delivery; if the mail is addressed to a remote system, it queues
the mail for forwarding to that system.
.PP
.II uuxqt
It is very unusual for a user to invoke
.B rmail
from the command line.
.B rmail
usually is invoked by another program; in particular, the command
.B uuxqt
invokes it to process mail uploaded from another machine via \*(UU.
.SH Options
.II uux
The command
.B uux
can pass options to
.B rmail
to control its behavior.
.B rmail
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-L\fR 0.3i
Hand all mail that whose address includes a \*(UU path to the local mailer
.B lmail
for processing,
presumably to make use of other transport mechanisms (e.g., Ethernet).
This option, and option
.BR \-l ,
defers all routing until
.B lmail
has re-forwarded the mail to
.B smail
for further processing.
.IP \fB\-l\fR
Hand all mail whose address includes a domain name to the local mailer
.B lmail
for processing, so they can be processed for non-\*(UU domains.
.IP "\fB\-q \fInumber\fR"
Set the queuing threshold to
.IR number .
When routing mail
to a given host,
.B rmail
checks the ``cost'' of contacting the host; this cost set in file
.BR /usr/lib/mail/paths .
If the cost is less the queueing threshold, then
.B rmail
sends the mail immediately; otherwise, it queues the mail for later shipment.
Under \*(CO, default queueing threshold is 100.
.IP \fB\-R\fR
Reroute \*(UU paths, trying successively larger righthand substrings
of a path until a component is recognized.
.IP \fB\-r\fR
Route the first component of a \*(UU path (\fBhost!address\fR)
in addition to routing domain addresses (\fBuser@domain\fR).
.IP "\fB\-u \fIuuxflags\fR"
Pass all
.I uuxflags
to the command
.B uux
for inclusion in the remote-mail command.
This overrides any of the default values and other queueing strategies.

.SH Notes
.B rmail
is a link to command
.BR smail .
For information on how
.B rmail
parses addresses and constructs headers, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR smail .
.PP
Because
.B rmail
is a link to
.BR smail ,
it actually recognizes all of
.BR smail 's
command-line options; however, it ignores all except those listed above.
