is specified,

prints the disk usage of the current directory.

to print a line for every file and directory in the substructure.
Normally it prints a line only for each directory.
.PP
The

(summary) option prints only the line for the top level directory.
.PP
.B du
understands links; it adds a file with more than one link to it
into the total only once.

.SH Notes
.B du
does not count file-system overhead such as indirect blocks,
so occasionally a directory does not fit on a file system
which appears to contain enough room for it.
