The preprocessing directive
.B #else
conditionally includes code within a program.
It is preceded by one of the directives
.BR #if ,
.BR #ifdef ,
or
.BR #ifndef ,
and may also be preceded by any number of
.B #elif
directives.
If the conditional expressions of all preceding directives
evaluate to false (i.e., to zero), then the code introduced by
.B #else
is included within the program, up to the
.B #endif
directive.

A
.BR #if ,
.BR #ifdef ,

directive can be followed by only one
.B #else
directive.
