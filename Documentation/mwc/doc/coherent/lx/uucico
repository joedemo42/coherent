.HE
The \*(UU daemon
.B uucico
is the program that communicates with a remote
.IR site .
It either contacts another site and issues commands for execution by another
.B uucico
process on that remote system (\fImaster\fR mode);
or it receives a call from a remote system
and executes the commands that that system issues (\fIslave\fR mode).
.PP
The commands
.B uucp
and
.BR uux
invoke
.B uucico
automatically, usually in master mode.
.B uucico
can also be invoked directly from the shell,
from within a script, or from with a
.B cron
file.
.PP
You can also name
.B uucico
in file
.B /etc/passwd
as the default process to run for a given login identifier.
A system that logs in under that login ID (presumably, a version of
.B uucico
on a remote system)
will interact with your system's
.BR uucico ,
instead of a shell.
When invoked in this manner,
.B uucico
runs in slave mode by default.
.PP
After
.B uucico
has finished communicating with the remote system,
it invokes the daemon
.B uuxqt
to execute the commands issued by the remote system.
For information on
.BR uuxqt ,
see its Lexicon entry.
.PP
.B uucico
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-c\fIsite\fR 0.75i
``Cron'' mode:
If a call is not permitted to
.I site
at the present time, then do not make the call; but also, do not
log an error message or update the system status.
Use this option if you wish to invoke
.B uucico
regularly through
.BR cron ,
and do not want to be bombarded with error messages should the entry in
.B cron
conflict with the legal calling times set in
.BR sys .
.IP "\fB\-D\fR"
Do not detach from the device until the contact with the remote system
concludes.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR"
Force
.B uucico
to produce its own
.B login:
and
.B Password:
prompts.
.B uucico
checks the password it receives against its own, private list, rather than
against the password kept in file
.BR /etc/passwd .
This should be used with the options
.B \-l
and
.BR \-p .
When used with this option,
.B uucico
does not terminate, but continues to issue prompts until you kill
it explicitly.
This option permits you to use
.B uucico
as a server on a network.
.IP "\fB\-f\fIsite\fR"
Force option:
call
.I site
immediately, regardless of whether the site's description in
.B sys
indicates that this is a legal time to call.
.IP "\fB\-I \fIfile\fR"
Read configuration information from
.IR file ,
instead of from the default file
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/sys .
.IP "\fB\-l\fR"
Force \fBuucico\fR to produce its own \fBlogin:\fR prompt.
.B uucico
checks the login it receives against its own, private list, rather than
against the normal system password files.
This should be used with the option
.BR \-e .
.IP "\fB\-q\fR"
Quiet:
do not invoke daemon
.B uuxqt
on the remote system.
.IP "\fB\-p\fIport\fR"
Use \fIport\fR.
When used with the options \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-S\fR,
dial out on \fIport\fR; this overrides the default port used with the
system being contacted.
When
.B uucico
is in slave mode, this implies the option
.BR \-e .
.IP \fB\-r0\fR
Act as slave in polling process; that is, carry out the orders of another
.B uucico
that has dialed into your system.
This is the default.
.IP \fB\-r1\fR
Act as master in polling process; that is, dial out to another system and
give it orders.
This option is implied by options
.B \-s
or
.BR \-S .
If the
.B uucico
command line does not name a site to call,
this option tells
.B uucico
to call any system for which work is waiting to be performed.
.IP "\fB\-s\fIsite\fR"
Call
.IR site .
This must name one of the entries in
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/sys .
.IP "\fB\-S\fIsite\fR"
Call
.I site
immediately, if the present time lies within the legal time set for
.IR site ,
as described in file
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/sys .
.IP "\fB\-w\fR"
After contacting a system with the options
.BR \-r1 ,
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-S ,
begin an endless loop of login prompts, as with the option
.BR -e .
In effect, \*(UU calls a remote site; but instead of logging into that site,
it lets that site log into it.
.II "UUCP^logging data, file"
.IP \fB\-x\fIactivity\fB[,\fIactivity\fB,...,\fIactivity^\fB]\fR
.IS \fB\-X\fIactivity\fB[,\fIactivity\fB,...,\fIactivity\^\fB]\fR
Log a given
.IR activity .
These logs can help you debug problems with \*(UU.
.B uucico
recognizes the following activities:
.DS
.ta 0.5i 2.0i 3.5i
.B
	abnormal	chat	config
	execute	handshake	incoming
	outgoing	port	proto
	spooldir	uucp-proto
.R
.DE
.IP
One \fB\-x\fR option can name multiple activities,
separated by commas.
A
.B uucico
command line can contain more than \fB\-x\fR option.
.II /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/audit.local
.B uucico
writes its logging information into file
.BR /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/audit.local .
.SH Example
To poll the site
.B mwcbbs
(the Mark Williams bulletin board)
five minutes after each hour, put the following entry into a
.B cron
file:
.DM
	05 * * * * /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -smwcbbs -r1
