or \fBL\fR (long-term)

The command
.B chreq
lets you change the printer, lifetime, and priority of a
.IR job ,
which identifies a print job spooled with the command
.BR lp .
It recognizes the following options:
.IP \fB\-d\fIprinter\fR 0.75i
Move \fIjob\fR to the queue for \fIprinter\fR.
.IP \fB\-l\fIlifetime\fR
Change the lifetime of \fIjob\fR, where
\fIlifetime\fR is one of \fBT\fR (temporary), \fBS\fR (short-term),
or \fBL\fR (long-term).
Temporary lifetime means that a job ``survives'' in the spool directory
for two hours after being
spooled; short-term means that it survives 48 hours; and
long-term that it survives for 72 hours.
After a job's lifetime has expired, the print daemon
.B lpsched
removes it.
.IP \fB\-p\fIpriority\fR
Change the despooling priority of \fIjob\fR to \fIpriority\fR, which is one of
\fB0\fR (highest priority) to \fB9\fR (lowest priority).
Jobs with high priority are printed before those with low priority.
The default priority is \fB2\fR.
