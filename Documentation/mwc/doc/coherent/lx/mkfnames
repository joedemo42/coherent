.PP
The script
.B mkfnames
generates a data base of users' names and addresses.
It reads the contents of
.IR namefile ,
which contains each user's names and her e-mail address;
invokes the command
.B nptx
to generate permutations of the users' names; then sorts the output of
.B nptx
and writes the sorted output onto the standard output.
If no
.I namefile
is named on the command line,
.B mkfnames
reads the file
.BR /etc/passwd ,
and parses its contents into the form required by command
.BR nptx .
.PP
.II fullnames
.II /usr/lib/mail/fullnames
.B mkfnames
is usually used to generate the file
.BR /usr/lib/mail/fullnames ,
which the mail system uses to translate a person's name into her
e-mail address.
If more than one login account has the same part of a name (i.e., the same
last name), the first login name in alphabetical order will be used.
