.B /etc/boottime
is an empty file maintained by the
.B init
process and the
.B date
command.
The modification time of
.BR boottime ,
as displayed by the command \fBls \-l\fR,
is the time that the system was last booted.
You can read the time shown by \fBboottime\fR with \fBls \-l\fR,
or with the system calls
.B stat
or
.BR fstat .

.SH Notes
Commands that depend upon
.B /etc/boottime
may malfunction if the system's date is not set correctly.
For instance, the
.B mount
command depends on the relative modification times of
.B /etc/boottime
and
.B /etc/mtab
to detect whether the mount table has been invalidated by a system boot.
If the date is set sufficiently far into the past, the mount table
may appear to be valid when in fact it is not.
