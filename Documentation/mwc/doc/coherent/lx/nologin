.B login
looks for file
.B /etc/nologin
before it permits a user to login in.
If this file exists,
.B login
forbids the user to log in, and instead displays on the terminal
the contents of this file \(em which, presumably, explain why logging
in is now forbidden.
.PP
You should
create this file when you wish to ``lock out'' users during a critical
time, such as when backups are being run or when the system is about to
be shut down.
When the critical time has passed, be sure to remove it.
.PP
.B login
cannot lock out the superuser
.BR root ,
even if
.B nologin
exists.
Nor will it lock out the users named in the file
.BR /etc/trustme ,
should it exist.

.SH Notes
.II rc
.II /etc/rc
The script
.B /etc/rc
removes
.B /etc/nologin
by default, on the assumption that after you reboot,
you once again want users to be able to log in.
If this is not a sound assumption, edit
.B /etc/rc
to change this behavior.
