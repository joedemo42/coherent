between two lines, but center it as a whole.
.IP \fB.BT\fR
Bottom title.
This controls the printing of the footer title, should you want one.
It uses three strings, all or any of which can be defined
by the user: \fBLF\fR, for left-hand portion; \fBCF\fR, for
center portion; and \fBRF\fR, for right-hand portion.
\fBCF\fR has the default definition of printing the page

Center individually every line within a display.
.IP \fB.DA\fR
Set the date.
.IP \fB.DE\fR

are longer than one page.
.IP \fB.NH\fR

This macro takes one argument:
the \fIdepth\fR of numbering.
For example,

No number higher than five is accepted here.
The following line gives the text of the heading.
