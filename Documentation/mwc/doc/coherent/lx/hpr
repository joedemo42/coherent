The command
.B hpr
spools each
.I file
for printing on the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.
If no
.I file
is named on the command line,
.B hpr
spools what it reads from the standard input.
.PP
.B hpr
recognizes the following options:
.IP \fB\-B\fR 0.65i
Suppress printing of a banner page.
Note that
.B hpr
outputs its banner in plain text; therefore, if you have a PostScript
printer, you
.I must
use this option.
If you do not, your printer will hang.
.IP "\fB\-b \fIbanner\fR"
Print
.I banner
on the banner page.
The default banner is the user's login identifier.
.IP \fB\-c\fR
Copy each
.I file
into the spooling directory, instead of reading the file from its home
directory.
This option lets you edit a
.I file
before it has finished printing.
.IP \fB\-e\fR
Erase all ``soft fonts'' from the printer's memory.
.IP "\fB\-f \fIfontnum file1 ... fileN\fR"
Load the Hewlett-Packard ``soft fonts'' stored in files
.I file1
through
.I fileN
into the printer's memory; set the font identifiers to begin at
.IR fontnum .
.IP \fB\-m\fR
Write a message on the user's terminal when printing completes.
.IP \fB\-n\fR
Do not send a message (default).
.IP \fB\-r\fR
Remove the files when they have been spooled.
.PP
The command
.B hpskip
aborts or restarts printing of the file that is currently being printed.
The command
.B hp
converts \fBnroff\fR output into a form usable by the LaserJet.
.SH Examples
To print the file \fBfoo\fR on the LaserJet, type:
.DM
	hpr -B foo
.DE
.PP
The following example loads the soft fonts in files
.BR foo ,
.BR bar ,
and
.B baz
into the printer's memory, and sets their font identifiers to begin at 15:
.DM
	hpr -f 15 foo bar baz
.DE

.SH Notes
Beginning with release 4.2, \*(CO also includes the
.B lp
print spooler.
.B lp
offers a more sophisticated way to manage printers, especially on
machines that support multiple printers of the same type.
For details, see the Lexicon entries for
.B printer
and
.BR lp .
