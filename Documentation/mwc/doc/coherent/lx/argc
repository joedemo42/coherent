.B argc
is an abbreviation for \*(QLargument count\*(QR.
It is the traditional name for the first argument to
a C program's
.B main
routine.
By convention, it holds the number of arguments that are passed to
.B main
in the argument vector
.BR argv .
Because
.B argv[0]
is always the name of the command,
the value of
.I argc
is always one greater than the number of command-line arguments
that the user enters.
