.PP
.B short
is a numeric data type.
The ANSI standard states that it
cannot be longer than an
.BR int .
.PP
\*(CO defines a
.B short
to be two bytes long;
thus,
.B "sizeof short"
equals two
.BR char s,
or 15 bits plus a sign, and can hold any value from \-32,768 to 32,767.
.PP
A
.B short
normally is sign extended when cast to a larger data type;
however, an
.B "unsigned short"
will be zero extended when cast.
