.HE
The \*(CO shell
.B sh
maintains an internal ``directory stack'', which is a stack of names of
directories.
You can manipulate this stack should you, for any reason, wish to traverse
a number of directories quickly and efficiently.
.PP
The command
.B pushd
pushes
.I directory1
through
.I directoryN
onto the directory stack, and
changes the current directory to the last directory pushed.
If called without an argument, it transposes the last two directories
on the directory stack.
