.TH MLP_SPOOL "" "" "Environmental Variable"
.PC "Pass user-specific information to print spooler"
.PP
When the command
.B lp
spools a job for printing, it reads the environmental variable
.B MLP_SPOOL
to find user-specific information for this job.
.B MLP_SPOOL
must have the following layout:
.DS
.ta 0.5iC 1.35iC 1.85i
	\fIOffset	Length	Description\fR
	0	10	Type of document (user-specific)
	10	3	Page length, lines per page (default, 66)
	13	14	Name of data base (user-specific)
	28	14	Name of program (user-specific)
	42	60	Title (user-specific)
.DE
.PP
With the exception of page length,
.B lp
uses none of these fields itself;
rather, it makes them available to whatever program the user (or system
administrator) has selected to process text before it is printed.
