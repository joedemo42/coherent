which are normally suppressed.

.SH Diagnostics
The dump/restore format puts a header at the beginning of the dump that
includes all the information about what lives where in the dump.
.B dumpdir
reads this header to discover what files are in the dump.
If the header is too large to fit onto one disk,
.B dumpdir
will then prompt you to insert the additional disk or disks;
if this happens, insert the requested disk and then type
.BR <return> .
.SH Notes
.B dump
requires that its output be written to disks that are free of bad sectors.
If you write a dump to a disk with bad sectors, you will not be able to
restore files from that disk.
For details on using disks with \fBdump\fR,
see its Lexicon entry.
