.TH port "" "" "System Administration"
.PC "File that describes ports for UUCP"
.B /usr/lib/uucp/port
.PP
File
.B /usr/lib/uucp/port
names and describes the serial ports that
.B uucico
and
.B cu
use to connect to remote systems.
.PP
.B port
consists of a set of entries, one for each port.
Entries should be separated from each other by one blank line.
Each entry consists of one or more of the following commands:
.IP "\fBport \fIport_name\fR"
Name the port being described.
This command must appear first in every port's entry.
.IP "\fBtype \fIstring\fR"
This command gives the type of port.
It must appear immediately after the \fBport\fR command.
.I string
must be one of the following:
.RS
.IP \fBdirect\fR
The port directly accesses another, usually via a serial port.
.IP \fBmodem\fR
The port accesses a modem.
This is the default.
.IP \fBpipe\fR
The connection is a pipe that runs through another program
.IP \fBstdin\fR
The connection runs through the standard input and standard output.
Use this option when
.B uucico
is run as a login shell
.IP \fBtcp\fR
The port is a TCP port.
.RE
.IP "\fBprotocol \fIstring\fR"
List the protocols that can be used with this port.
If
.B /usr/lib/uucp/sys
contains a list of protocols, that list takes precedence over the one set in
.BR port .
We recommend that protocols be specified in the file
.B sys
intsead of here.
For information on the available protocols, see the Lexicon article
.BR sys .
.IP "\fBprotocol-parameter \fIprotocol parameter\fR"
Set a
.I parameter
for the
.IR protocol .
This command recognizes exactly the same arguments as its namesake in the
system-configuration file
.BR sys .
For information on how to use this command, see the Lexicon entry for
.IP "\fBseven-bit true|false\fR"
.II "seven-bit parity"
If
.BR true ,
then this port (or the modem plugged into it ) supports only
seven-bit transfers;
if false, then it supports both seven-bit and eight-bit protocols.
.B uucico
uses this command only during protocol negotiation, to force the
selection of a protocol that works across a seven-bit link.
It will not prevent eight-bit characters from being transmitted.
The default is
.BR false .
.IP
Note that
some devices use only seven bits to define a character, and reserve the
eighth bit as a parity bit.
It is not possible it is not possible to send eight-bit characters across
such devices.
.IP "\fBreliable true|false\fR"
This command is used only when your system negotiates with the remote system
over what protocol to use.
If set to
.BR false ,
it forces your system to accept only a protocol that works over a
seven-bit (or unreliable) connection.
If
.BR true ,
then an eight-bit protocol is acceptable.
The default is false.
.IP "\fBhalf-duplex true|false\fR"
If
.BR true ,
then this port supports only half-duplex communications,
which forces
.B uucico
not to use a bidirectional protocol with this port.
If it is
.BR false ,
then the port supports both half-duplex and full-duplex communications.
The default is
.BR false .
.BR sys .
.IP "\fBdevice \fIstring\fR"
This command names the device associated with the port.
For example, the command
.DM
	device /dev/com2l
.DE
.IP
names port
.B com2l
as the device used by this port.
This command is used only with ports of types
.B modem
or
.BR direct .
.IP "\fBbaud \fInumber\fR"
.IS "\fBspeed \fInumber\fR"
Set the baud rate for this port.
If an entry in file
.B /usr/lib/uucp/sys
specifies a speed but no port entry,
.B uucico
tries every entry in
.B port
that has a matching baud rate,
in the order in which they appear,
until it finds one that is unlocked.
These commands are used only with ports of type
.B modem
or
.BR direct .
.IP "\fBbaud-range \fIlow high\fR"
.IS "\fBspeed-range \fIlow high\fR"
Set the range of speeds at which this port can be run.
.I low
gives the minimum speed,
.I high
the maximum.
This command applies only to ports of type
.BR modem .
.IP "\fBcarrier true|false\fR"
If
.BR true ,
the port supports carrier; if
.BR false ,
the port does not.
If a port does not support carrier, the carrier-detect signal will never
be required on this port, regardless of what the modem chat script says.
If a direct port supports carrier, the port will be set always
to expect carrier.
.IP
This command applies only to ports of type
.B direct
or
.BR modem .
The default for a
.B modem
port is true; but for a
.B direct
port is false.
.IP "\fBhardflow true|false\fR"
If
.BR true ,
turn on hardware flow control for this port; otherwise, do not.
The default is
.BR true .
This command applies only to ports of type
.B direct
or
.BR modem .
.IP "\fBdial-device \fIdevice\fR"
Send dialing instructions to
.IR device ,
instead of the the normal port device.
This applies only to ports of type
.BR modem .
.IP "\fBdialer \fIstring\fR"
Names the dialer to use.
Information about the dialer is read from file
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/dial .
This applies only to ports of type
.BR modem . 
.IP "\fBdialer \fIstring ...\fR"
Execute a simple dialing script.
This command can be used in situations where the dialing script is so simple
that it would be cumbersome to embed it within a separate file.
If the command
.B dialer
is used with only one argument (to name a dialing script), this command
is ignored.
This applies only to ports of type
.BR modem . 
.IP "\fBdialer-sequence \fIdialer phone_number ...\fR"
Name pairs of dialers and telephone numbers.
The telephone number is substituted for the escape sequences
.B \eD
or
.B \eT
in the
.I dialer
entry.
In effect, this lets you name a sequence of chat scripts to use.
At present, this command is the only way to use a chat script with a
TCP port.
.IP
This command applies only to ports of type
.B modem
or
.BR tcp .
.IP "\fBlockname \fIname\fR"
Use
.I name
when locking this port.
This applies only to ports of type
.B modem
or
.BR direct .
.IP "\fBservice \fIservice_name\fR"
Name the TCP port to use.
If this names a service, then
.B uucico
looks the port for that service in file
.BR /etc/services .
If it is a number, then
.B uucico
binds itself to that TCP port.
If this command is not used, then
.B uucico
by default uses the well-known port 540.
This command applies only to ports of type
.BR tcp .
.IP "\fBcommand \fIcommand \fB[ \fIarguments \fB]\fR"
If the port is of type
.BR pipe ,
name the command and its arguments with which
.B uucico
will be exchanging data.
.II rlogin
For example, if your system is on a network, then
.I command
could a form of the command
.BR rlogin ,
which would permit
.B uucico
to log into the remote system via the network.
.SH Example
The following gives a sample entry for a port:
.DM
	port MWCBBS
	type modem
	device /dev/com2l
	baud 9600
	dialer tbfast
.DE
The following describes each command in detail:
.IP \fBport\fR
This names the port being described in this entry, in this case
.BR MWCBBS .
.IP \fBtype\fR
The type of port \(em in this case, a modem.
.IP \fBdevice\fR
The device used by this port.
The device name usually matches the port name, but it does not have to.
.IP \fBbaud\fR
The speed of the port, in this case 9600.
.IP \fBdialer\fR
The type of dialing device (i.e., modem) plugged into this
port \(em in this case, the dialer named
.BR tbfast .
This dialer is described in the file
.BR /usr/lib/uucp/dial .
For information on how a dialer is described in its file,
see the Lexicon entry for
.BR dial .

The file

supports many commands in addition to the ones described here.
This article describes only those commands that might be used
in typical \*(UU connections.
