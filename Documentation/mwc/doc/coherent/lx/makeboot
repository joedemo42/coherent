.SH Notes
.II /etc/mount
.B makeboot
reads file
.B /bin/mount
to discover whether floppy-disk drive 0 is 3.5 inches or 5.25 inches.
This file was initialized when you last installed or updated \*(CO.
If you have changed your A drive since then,
.B makeboot
may think it is working with one size of floppy disk when in fact it is
working with another.
To correct this error, abort
.BR makeboot ,
then edit
.B /etc/mount
so that it reflects your system's true configuration of disk drives.
