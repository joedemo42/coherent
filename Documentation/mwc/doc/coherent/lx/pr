\fBpr [ \fIoptions \fB] [ \fIfile .\^.\^.\^\fB]\fR
.PP
.HS
.SH Options:
.IC \fB\+\fIskip\fR
Skip the first \fIskip\fR pages of input before printing
.IC \fI\-cols\fR
Print the input in \fIcols\fR columns
.IC \fB\-h\fR
The next argument is the header (replaces file name)
.IC \fB\-l\fIn\fR
Set page size to \fIn\fR lines (default, 66)
.IC \fB\-m\fR
Print each input \fIfile\fR in a separate column
.IC \fB\-n\fR
Number the output lines
.IC \fB\-s\fIc\fR
Separate each column with character \fIc\fR
.IC \fB\-t\fR
Suppress top and bottom margins and header
.IC \fB\-w\fIn\fR
Page width is set to \fIn\fR columns (default, 80)
.Pp
A \fIfile\fR named `-' means stdin.
.HE
.B pr
paginates each
.I file
and writes it onto the standard output.
At the top of each page,
.B pr
writes a header that that gives today's date,
the file's name, the number of the page, and the number of the line
in the input file at which printing begins.
.PP
The file name `-' tells
.B pr
to read the standard input; this lets you mingle text from one or more
files with text you type from the keyboard or pipe in from another program.
.B pr
also reads the standard input by default if its command line does not name
a file.
.PP
.B pr
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB+\fI skip\fR"
Skip the first
.I skip
pages of each input file.
.IP \fB\-\fIN\fR
Print the text in
.I N
columns.
This is used to print out material that was typed in one or more columns.
.IP "\fB\-h \fIheader\fR"
Use
.I header
in place of the text name in the title.
If \fIheader\fR is more than one word long, it must be
enclosed in quotation marks.
.IP \fB\-l\fIN\fR
Set the page length to
.I N
lines (default, 66).
.IP \fB\-m\fR
Print the texts simultaneously, in separate columns.
Each text will be assigned an equal amount of width on
the page, and any lines longer than that width will be
truncated.
You can use this to print several similar texts or listings simultaneously.
.IP \fB\-n\fR
Number each line.
.IP \fB\-s\fIc\fR
Separate each column by the character
.IR c .
You can separate columns with a letter of the alphabet, a period,
or an asterisk.
Normally, each column is left-justified in a fixed-width field.
.IP \fB\-t\fR
Suppress the printing of the header on each page, and the
header and footer space.
.IP \fB\-w\fIN\fR
Set the page width to
.I N
columns (default, 80).
Text lines are truncated to fit the column width.
The maximum width is 254 columns.

.SH Notes
.B pr
generates normal ASCII text, suitable for displaying on your screen or
printing with a dot-matrix printer.
The command
.B prps
also paginates text, but its output is in the PostScript language,
suitable for printing on a PostScript printer.
