.TH stack "" "" Definition

.PP
The
.B stack
is the segment of memory that holds function arguments,
local variables, function return addresses, and stack frame linkage
information.
.PP
If your program uses recursive algorithms, or declares large amounts
of automatic data, or simply contains many levels of functions calls,
the stack may \*(QLoverflow\*(QR, and overwrite the program data.
Note that this is unlikely with \*(CO, because the 80386 has
implemented dynamic stack allocation.
