.II "terminfo^compile source file"
The command
.B tic
compiles a
.I sourcefile
of \fBterminfo\fR information into a binary object.
.PP
.I sourcefile
must be self-contained, i.e., it may not
contain ``use'' entries that refer to terminals not described fully
in the same file.
.PP
The object files generated by
.B tic
are normally placed into subdirectories of the directory
.BR /usr/lib/terminfo .
If the environment variable
.B TERMINFO
is defined, it is assumed to name an alternative directory to use.
.PP
The flag \fB\-v\fIn\fR tells
.B tic
to output debugging and tracing information.
.I n
sets the amount of debugging information to produce, as follows:
.DS
	1	Names of files created
	2	Information related to the ``use'' facility
	3	Statistics from the hashing algorithm
	5	String-table memory allocations
	7	Entries into the string-table
	8	List of tokens encountered by scanner
	9	All values computed in construction of the hash table
