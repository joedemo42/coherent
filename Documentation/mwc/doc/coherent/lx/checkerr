.PP
The script
.B checkerr
reads error reports that have been deposited into the error directory
.BR /usr/spool/smail/error .
.II postmaster
If it finds an error,
.B checkerr
concatenates them into file
.BR /usr/spool/smail/.checkerror ,
and mails that file to user
.B postmaster
on your system.
If mail cannot be sent to
.BR postmaster
for any reason,
.B checkerr
leaves the file in place; when you next invoke this command,
it will again try to mail the error messages.
