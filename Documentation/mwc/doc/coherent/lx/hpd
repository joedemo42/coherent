.PC "Spooler daemon for laser printer"
.B /usr/lib/hpd
.PP
.B hpd
is the daemon that prints jobs spooled by the command \fBhpr\fR.
All jobs are printed on the printer that is accessed through device
.BR /dev/hp .
For information on this device, and on printer management in general,
see the Lexicon entry
.BR printer .
.PP
The command \fBhpr\fR invokes
.B hpd
automatically.
If there is no printing to do, or if another daemon is already running
(as indicated by the file \fBdpid\fR), \fBhpd\fR exits immediately.
Otherwise, it searches the spool directory for control files of listings
to print.
A control file contains the names of files to print, the user name,
banner pages, and files to be removed upon completion.
.PP
.B hpd
does not print listings in any particular order.
There is no prioritization of printing, either by size or by requester.
.PP
The command
.B hpskip
aborts or restarts printing of the job currently being printed by
.BR hpd .
