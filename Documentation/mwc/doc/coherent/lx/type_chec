.TH "type checking" "" "" "Definition"
.PC
.PP
Every expression has a \fItype\fR, such as
.BR int ,
.BR char ,
or
.BR double .
C is not strongly typed, which means that it allows different types
to be mixed relatively freely, and be changed (or \fBcast\fR)
from one type to another.
.PP
\*(PN checks types
more strictly than the C standard implies.
\*(PN's type checking can be enabled or disabled in degrees, using
\fB\-VSTRICT\fR and other \*(QLvariant\*(QR options with the \fBcc\fR command.
