.PC "Print who is logged in"
\fBwho [\fIfile\fB] [am i]\fR
.PP
The command
.B who
prints the names of the users who are logged in to the system.
For each user,
.B who
prints her name, terminal name, login date, and login time.
The form
.B "who am i"
prints this information only about yourself.
.PP
If
.I file
is specified,
.B who
uses it instead of
.B /etc/utmp
to obtain information about who is logged in.
This is useful, for example, with the file
.BR /usr/adm/wtmp ,
which contains a continuous record of logins, logouts and reboots.
When
.I file
is specified,
.B who
displays logouts; otherwise, they are suppressed.
