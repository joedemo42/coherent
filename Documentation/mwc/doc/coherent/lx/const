The type qualifier
.B const
marks an object as being unmodifiable.
An object declared as being
.B const
cannot be used on the left side of an assignment (an \fIlvalue\fR),
or have its value modified in any way.
Because of these restrictions, an implementation may place
objects declared to be
.B const
into a read-only region of storage.
