.B "/etc/conf/stune"
.PP
File
.B stune
names each tunable variable within the kernel, and gives the value to which
it is actually set.
Command
.B idmkcoh
reads this file when it builds a new kernel, and uses its contents to patch
the kernel appropriately.
.PP
Each entry within this file has two fields.
The first field names the variable; the name must match that given in
.BR stune .
The second field gives the value of the variable; this value must
fall between the minimum and maximum values given in
.BR stune .
.PP
If a line begins with a pound sign `#', it is a comment and
.B idmkcoh
ignores it.
If a tunable variable is not named in this file,
.B idmkcoh
uses the default value given in
.BR stune .
