.B lines
to keep track of a game between them by moving with the \*(QLM\*(QR command.
Alternatively, one player can play
against the computer by moving with the \*(QLm\*(QR command.
The program uses a tree-search technique to consider possible moves;
the player can vary the speed of the program's replies
with commands that change the tree search width and depth.
