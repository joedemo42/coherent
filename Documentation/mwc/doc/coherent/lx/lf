.B lf
is a link to the command
.BR "ls \-CF" .
It prints 
.I file
in columnar format, like the command
.BR lc .

however, combines files and directories into one listing, with
directories being indicated by a slash after the file name and executable
being indicated by an asterisk.
If a
.I file
is a directory,
.B l
lists its contents.
If no
.I file
is named,
.B lf
lists the contents of the current directory by default.
