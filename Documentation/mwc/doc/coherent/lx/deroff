.B deroff
removes text formatting control information from each input text
.IR file ,
or from the standard input if no
.I file
is specified.
It regards all lines that begin with \*(Ql.\*(Qr or \*(Ql'\*(Qr as being
.B nroff
or
.B troff
commands and deletes them.
.B deroff
also recognizes some additional control lines.
It deletes
.B eqn
information (between
.B \&.EQ
and
.B \&.EN
lines),
.B tbl
information (between
.B \&.TS
and
.B \&.TE
lines),
and macro definitions.
It also deletes embedded
.B \&.eqn
requests.
It expands source file inclusion with
.B \&.so
and
.B \&.nx
requests, with the proviso that no input file is read twice.
It also deletes some
.B troff
escape sequences, such as those for font and size change.

When the

flag is present,

that commences with a letter.
