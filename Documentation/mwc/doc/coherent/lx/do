.PP
.B do
is a C control statement that introduces a loop.
Unlike
.B for
and
.B while
loops, the condition in a
.B do
loop is evaluated
.I after
the operation is performed.
.B do
always works in tandem with
.BR while ;
for example
.DM
do {
	puts("Next entry? ");
	fflush(stdout);
} while(getchar() != EOF);
.DE
.PP
prints a prompt on the screen and waits for the user to reply.
The
.B do
loop is convenient in this instance because the prompt must appear
at least once on the screen before the user replies.
