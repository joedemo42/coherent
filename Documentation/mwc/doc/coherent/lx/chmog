.TH chmog "" "" Command
.PC "Change mode, owner, and group simultaneously"
\fBchmog \fImod own grp file ...\fR
.PP
.II chmod
.II chown
.II chgrp
.B chmog
combines the functionality of the commands
.BR chmod ,
.BR chown ,
and
.B chgrp
into one command.
This lets you fine-tune the permissions on 
.IR file s
without having to type three separate commands.
.PP
The arguments
.IR mode ,
.IR own ,
and
.I grp
give, respectively, the mode, owner, and group to which
.B chmog
sets
.IR file .
Setting any of these three arguments `-' means that that feature of
.I file
is not changed.
For example, the command
.DM
	chmog - bin bin file_name
.DE
.PP
changes the owner and group of file
.B file_name
to
.B bin
and does not alter
.BR file_name 's
permissions.
.PP
For details on how to set
.IR mode ,
.IR own ,
and
.IR grp ,
see the Lexicon entries for, respectively,
.BR chmod ,
.BR chown ,
and
.BR chgrp .
