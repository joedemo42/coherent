.B libedit.a
is a library of routines that implement a simple tool for entering
and editing lines of data.
The includes two routines that can be called from a user-level program:
.IP \fBreadline()\fR
Read a line of input from the standard input, and let the user edit it.
.IP \fBadd_history()\fR
Add a line of edited input into a history buffer, from which the user can
retrieve it for further editing and use.
.PP
Each is described in its own Lexicon entry.
.PP
These routines implement a simple, EMACS-like line-editing interface,
much like the one available under the Korn shell \fBksh\fR.
To include these routines in an application, just call them as you would
any other library function, and link the library
.B libedit.a
into the executable.
