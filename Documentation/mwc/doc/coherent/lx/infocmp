.PC "De-compile a terminfo file"
\fBinfocmp [\fIfile ... \fB]\fR
.PP
.II "terminfo^de-compile binary"
.B infocmp
reads a set of compiled terminal information, decodes its contents, and
writes the decoded information to the standard output.
It does its best to recreate the
.B terminfo
source from which the set of information had been compiled.
.PP
.I file
must hold compiled
.B terminfo
information.
If no
.I file
is named on the command line,
.B infocmp
reads the standard input.
.PP
.II TERMINFO
.II "environmental variables^TERMINFO"
.B infocmp
first seeks
.I file
in the directory named by the environmental variable
.BR TERMINFO .
If this variable has not been set,
it seeks
.I file
in the default directory
.BR /usr/lib/terminfo .
Thus, you can type the command
.DM
	infocmp ansipc
.DE
.PP
in any directory and
.B infocmp
builds the appropriate path on its own.
.PP
In case of emergency, the output of
.B infocmp
can be piped to the
.B terminfo
compiler
.BR tic .
