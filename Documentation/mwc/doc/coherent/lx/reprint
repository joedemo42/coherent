.SH Notes
You should be
.I very
careful that jobs to print sensitive information \(em e.g., the payroll
checks or your resume \(em do not linger in spool directory where other
users can reprint them.
For information on resetting a job's lifetime, see the Lexicon entries for
.BR chreq ,
.BR printer ,
and
.BR MLP_LIFE .
The article
.B controls
describes how to change the default life expectancies for spooled jobs.
