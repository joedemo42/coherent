.SH Notes
Release 4.2 of \*(CO has changed
.B rewind()
to conform to the \*(AS.
Prior to release 4.2,
.B rewind()
returned EOF if an error occurs, and otherwise returned zero.
.B rewind()
now returns nothing.
Programs that depend upon the return value of
.B rewind()
should be modified to conform to this change.
