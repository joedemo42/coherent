.B cdplayer
gives you a text-based interface with which you can play audio compact disks
(CDs) through a \*(CO CD-ROM device.
It reads environmental variable
.B CD_DEVICE
for the name of the device to manipulate.
If this variable is not set, by default
.B cdplayer
manipulates device
.BR /dev/cdrom .
.PP
.B cdplayer
normally is invoked with one of the following commands.
If you invoke it without a command (or with a command it does not recognize),
it prints a usage message and exits.
If an error occurs,
.B cdplayer
returns an exit status of one.
.B cdplayer
recognizes the following commands:
.IP \fBeject\fR
Eject the CD from the drive.
Note that not every CD drive supports this feature; in particular, the
Mitsumi model LU005 does not.
.IP \fBinfo\fR
Display information about the CD that is in the drive:
the total number of tracks, total playing time, playing time per track,
drive status, and track being played.
.IP \fBpause\fR
Pause the audio CD.
Unlike the command
.BR stop ,
described below,
.B cdplayer
remembers the point at which playing stopped, and will resume playing
at that point.
If the CD is not playing,
.B cdplayer
ignores this command.
To restart a paused CD, use the command
.BR "cdplayer resume" .
.IP "\fBplay [\fItrack\^\fB]\fR"
Play the CD, beginning at
.IR track .
If no
.I track
is given, it begins as track one.
.IP \fBresume\fR
Resume playing a paused CD.
If the CD had not been paused,
.B cdplayer
ignores this command.
.IP \fBskip\fR
Skip to the next track.
If the CD is on its last track,
.B cdplayer
returns it to its first track.
.IP \fBstop\fR
Stop playing this CD.
If the CD is not being played,
.B cdplayer
ignores this command.
The CD player ``forgets'' the point at which it had been playing the CD.
To begin playing this CD again, use the command
.BR "cdplayer play" .
.IP "\fBvolume \fIlevel\fR"
Set the CD drive's volume to
.IR level ,
which must be a number between 0 (softest) and 255 (loudest).
Note that not every drive supports this feature.
