.TH MLP_FORMLEN "" "" "Environmental Variable"
.PC "Set default page length"
.PP
When the command
.B lp
spools a job for printing,
it reads the environmental variable
.B MLP_FORMLEN
to find the length, in lines,
of the form on which the job is to be printed.
.II pica
In the United States, a
.I line
is defined to be one pica high (that is, one sixth of an inch).
The default is length 66 lines (11 inches).
.II units
(NB, the \*(CO command
.B units
gives a handy way to convert from picas or inches into metric units.)
.PP
The printer daemon
.B lpsched
uses this information to help it count pages of input \(em
so you can specify the range of pages that it should print.
Unfortunately,
.B lpsched
identifies a page by counting lines of input, so this feature works only
it prints ``straight'' text.
It does \fInot\fR work correctly with ``cooked'' input, such as
files of PostScript or PCL.
