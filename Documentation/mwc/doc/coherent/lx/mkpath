The script
.B mkpath
is a wrapper for the command
.BR pathalias ,
which generates a set of paths among computers.
.PP
File
.I path_config
holds the data that are passed to
.BR pathalias ;
if it is set to `-', then
.B pathalias
reads the standard input.
If no
.I path_config
is named on the command line,
.B mkpath
by default uses file
.BR /usr/lib/mail/maps/mkpath.conf .
.PP
