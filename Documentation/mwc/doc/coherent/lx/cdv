\fBcdv [\fIdirectory\^\fB]\fR
.PP
.II CD-ROM
The script
.B cdv
provides a easy-to-use interface to the set of commands that interrogate
an ISO-9660 CD-ROM.
It is designed to spare you the trouble of having to remember the names
and syntax used by each of these commands.
If you name a
.I directory
on its command line,
.B cdv
uses that directory within the CD-ROM's file system as its root file system;
otherwise, it begins its work in the CD-ROM's default root directory.
The advantage of this option is that CD-ROM file systems tend to hold many
files, and reading the CD-ROM can be quite slow (depending upon the
speed of your system and of your CD-ROM reader); making
.I directory
the root directory lessens the number of files
.B cdv
must paw through before it finds the material that interests you.
Obviously, you must have some idea of the CD-ROM's contents before
you can use this option.
.PP
After you invoke
.BR cdv ,
it displays the prompt:
.DM
	Command:
.DE
.PP
Enter the command that you want
.BR cdv
to execute, as follows:
.IP "\fBcd \fIdirectory\fR"
Change directory.
.I directory
is the directory to enter.
This can be a relative path name or absolute path name.
As with the \*(CO command
.BR cd ,
you can use `.' and `..' as synonyms for, respectively, the current
directory and the parent directory.
.IP "\fBG \fIdirectory\fR"
Read the contents of
.IR directory .
.IP "\fBg \fIfile\fR"
Get
.IR file ;
copy it into the current directory.
.IP "\fBN\fR"
.IS "\fBn\fR"
Because the contents of a CD-ROM's directory may not fit onto the screen,
.B cdv
lets you display a directory's contents one page at a time.
These commands display the next page of the current directory's contents.
.IP "\fBP\fR"
.IS "\fBp\fR"
Display the previous page of the current directory's contents.
.IP \fBQ\fR
.IS \fBq\fR
Quit.
.IP "\fBv \fIfile\fR"
View
.IR file ,
which is on the CD-ROM.
.B cdv
displays
.I file
with the pager named in the environmental variable
.BR $PAGER .
If this variable is not defined, it uses
.BR more .
.IP \fB!\fR
Invoke the shell.
To return to
.BR cdv ,
type
.BR exit ,
to exit from the shell.
