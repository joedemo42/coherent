The command
.B ftbad
lets you manipulate the list of bad blocks on a floppy-tape cartridge.
It recognizes the following options:
.IP \fB\-r\fR 0.3i
Read the list of bad blocks from floppy-tape cartridge, and write them to
the standard-output device.
The output will appear something like the following:
.DM
	557
	1033
	89640
.DE
.IP \fB\-w\fR
Read a list of bad blocks from the standard-input device, and write it onto
the floppy-tape cartridge.
.IP \fIdevice\fR
The floppy-tape device to manipulate.
If you do not name a device on
.BR ftbad 's
command line, by default it uses
.BR /dev/ft ,
which rewinds the tape upon close.
For a list of tape devices that you can use the Lexicon entry for
.BR tape .
.SH Example
To modify the bad block list for a cartridge, do the following:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
First, use the command:
.DM
	ftbad -r > badlist
.DE
.PP
This reads the list of bad blocks and writes it into file
.BR badlist .
.IP \(bu
Second, edit
.BR badlist .
Each line in this file will name only one bad block, in decimal notation.
.IP \(bu
Finally, write the edited list back onto the tape cartridge with the command:
.DM
	ftbad -w < badlist
.DE

.SH Notes
Do not change the bad block list of a tape that contains data
you wish to retrieve.
You should use
.B ftbad
only when you see repeated I/O errors at the same block on a tape
and wish to mark that block as being bad before you reuse the tape.
