.PP
An
.B int
is the most commonly used numeric data type,
and is normally used to encode integers.
Under \*(CO 386, an
.B int
is the same size as a
.BR long ;
\fBsizeof int\fR equals 4 (31 bits plus a sign bit),
and can hold any value from
\-2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.
Under \*(CO 286, an
.B int
is the same size as a
.BR short ;
that is,
\fBsizeof int\fR equals 2
(15 bits plus a sign bit), and can hold any value from
from \-32768 to +32767.
.PP
An
.B int
normally is sign extended when cast to a larger data type;
an
.BR "unsigned int" ,
however, will be zero extended.
