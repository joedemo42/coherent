is an array of strings, called the

of a process.

Normally, each process inherits the environment of its parent process.
The shell
.B sh
and various forms of
.B exec
can change the environment.
The shell adds the name and value of each shell variable marked for
.I export
to the environment of subsequent commands.
The shell adds assignments given on the same line as a command to
the environment of the command,
without affecting subsequent commands.
