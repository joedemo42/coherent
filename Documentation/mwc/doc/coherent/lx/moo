.B moo
is a guessing game of numbers, typically four digits, all different.
.PP
The game randomly selects a number that consists of
.I numdigits
unique digits.
Obviously,
.I numdigits
cannot exceed ten; the default is four.
.B moo
then prompts you to guess the number it has selected.
When you type your guess,
.B moo
responds with one of two possible answers.
If you guess the number correctly, i.e., win,
.B moo
responds with
``Right!''.
If any of the digits that you guessed were correct digits,
but in the wrong place, you get a ``cow.''
If you guess a digit correctly and in the correct place,
you get a ``bull.''
If the number of ``bulls''
is the same as the number of digits in the guess, you win.
.B moo
typically responds with a count of
``bulls'' and ``cows,'' as in:
.DM
	2 bulls, 1 cow.
