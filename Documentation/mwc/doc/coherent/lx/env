.TH ENV "" "" "Environmental Variable"
.PC "File read to set environment"
.PP
Whenever the Korn shell is invoked,
it executes the script named in the environmental variable
.BR ENV .
By custom, this is set to
.BR ${HOME}/.kshrc ,
although you can name any file you wish.
This script usually sets aliases and environmental variables, and
executes the \fBset\fR command to modify the behavior of the shell itself.
.PP
By defining
.B ENV
in your
.BR .profile ,
you can ensure that this file is executed whenever you invoke a shell.
If you wish to have its definitions read only by the login shell, insert
the instruction
.DM
	unset ENV
.DE
.PP
at the end of the script named by
.BR ENV .
