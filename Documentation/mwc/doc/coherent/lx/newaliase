.TH newaliases "" "" Command
.PC "Build the smail aliases data base from an ASCII source file"
.B /usr/lib/mail/newaliases
.PP
Command
.B newaliases
reads the ASCII source file for an aliases data base,
and builds the aliases data base according to the configuration information in
.BR /usr/lib/mail/config .
Run this program whenever changes have been made to the ASCII source file.
If this program is not used,
.B smail
may not notice the changes that have been made.
.PP
The aliases data base can be in a DBM data base, a
sorted text file, or a plain text file.
(For information about what a DBM data base is, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR libgdbm .)
In the latter case, which is the default under \*(CO,
the ASCII source file doubles as the data-base file.
.PP
To process an file, first use the command
.B mkline
to remove comments and regularize it.
If you wish to build a sorted data base, then use the command
.B mksort
with its command-line option
.B \-f
to create the sorted data base.
If you wish, however, to build a DBM data base, use command
.BR mkdbm ,
again with option
.BR \-f ,
to create the data base.
In either case, be careful that
.B smail
never uses a truncated or partially built data base.
.PP
For plain text data bases,
.B newaliases
displays a summary of its contents, but no changes are actually made.
