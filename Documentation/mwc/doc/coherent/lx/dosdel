.II "MS-DOS^delete a file from"
.B dosdel
deletes
.I file
that lives on \*(MD file-system
.IR device .
The \*(MD file system can reside either on a floppy disk,
or on the \*(MD segment of a hard disk on your system.
The \*(MD file system must be named using
the device that holds it,
such as floppy-disk drive
.B /dev/fha0
or hard-disk partition
.BR /dev/at0a .
You can also build a file of aliases so that
you can access the drives as
.BR a ,
.BR b ,
etc.
For details, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR doscp ,
which explains how to set up defaults for the \fBdos\fR family of commands.

.SH Example
The following command deletes
.BR myfile .
It assumes that you have defined
.B c
to be a default for a device upon which you have set an \*(MD file system:
.DM
	dosdel c:/mydir/myfile

.SH Notes
.B dosdel
does not understand compressed \*(MD file systems created by programs such as
.B Stacker
or \*(MD 6.0
.BR dblspace .
If you are running \*(MD with file compression,
you must copy files to an uncompressed file system
(for example, to an uncompressed floppy disk or to the uncompressed
host for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the
.BR dosdel .
