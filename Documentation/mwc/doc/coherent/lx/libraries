.PP
A
.B library
is an archive file of commonly used functions that have been compiled,
tested, and stored for inclusion in a program at link time.
.PP
The \*(CO system stores its libraries in two directories:
.B /usr/lib
and
.BR /lib .
or their subdirectories:
The following libraries are kept in \fB/usr/lib\fR:
.LB
\fBlibcurses.a\fR	\fBcurses\fR library and \fBterminfo\fR functions
\fBlibedit.a\fR		Routines to gather and edit user input
\fBlibgdbm.a\fR	Library for GNU DBM functions
\fBlibl.a\fR		\fBlex\fR library
\fBlibmp.a\fR	Multi-precision arithmetic library
\fBlibsocket.a\fR	\fBsockets\fR emulation library
\fBlibterm.a\fR	Functions to read \fBtermcap\fR data
\fBliby.a\fR	\fByacc\fR library
\fBlib.b\fR	\fBbc\fR's function library (in \fBbc\fR source)
.PP
The following libraries are kept in
.BR /lib :
.LB
\fBlibc.a\fR	General functions and system calls
\fBlibm.a\fR	Mathematics routines
.PP
In addition, \*(CO comes with a library of miscellaneous routines, called
.BR libmisc .
See the Lexicon article
.B libmisc
for information on how to prepare this library for use.
