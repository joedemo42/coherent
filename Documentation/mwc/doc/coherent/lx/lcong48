Computation of 48-bit pseudo-random numbers uses two 48-bit integers
and one 16-bit integer.
One of the 48-bit values holds the ``seed'' value from which the
48-bit pseudo-random value is computed.
This seed can be set explicitly, or is the previously computed
pseudo-random number.
The other 48-bit integer holds the multiplier from which the pseudo-random
number is computed; and the 16-bit integer gives holds the addend.

Function
.B lcong48()
initializes the variables used to compute 48-bit pseudo-random numbers.
.I param
is an array of seven unsigned short integers that hold the initializers:
.IB param [0]
through
.IB param [2]
hold the ``seed'';
.IB param [3]
through
.IB param [5]
hold the multiplier;
and
.IB param [6]
holds the addend.
.PP
.B lcong48()
returns nothing.
