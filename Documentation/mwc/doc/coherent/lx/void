The keyword
.B void
indicates that the function does not return a value.
Using
.B void
declarations makes programs clearer and is useful in error checking.
For example, a function that prints an error message and calls
.B exit
to terminate a program should be declared
.B void
because it never returns.
A function that performs a calculation and stores its result in a global
variable (rather than \fBreturn\fRing the result), or one that
returns no value, should also be declared
.B void
to prevent the accidental use of the function in an expression.
