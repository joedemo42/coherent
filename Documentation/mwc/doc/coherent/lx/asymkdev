.PC "Create nodes for asynchronous devices"
\fB/conf/asymkdev \[\-u] [\fIasync_file\^\fB [\fIoutfile\^\fB]]\fR
.PP
The command
.B asymkdev
reads
.IR async_file ,
questions the user about her system, and writes a shell script into
.IR outfile .
When run, the script creates the proper nodes (up to 256 of them) for the
asynchronous devices in
.BR /dev .
.PP
If you name no
.IR async_file ,
.B asymkdev reads
.BR /dev/default/async .
If you name no
.IR outfile ,
it writes its script into
.BR asy_mknod .
.PP
.B asymkdev
asks about each asynchronous channel for which a port is configured.
It asks for the basic device name (e.g.,
.B asy00
or
.BR com0 ),
and then asks which of the eight possible port configurations will be used.
The options are:
.IP "\fBl\fR or \fBr\fR" 0.75i
Local or remote.
.IP "\fBi\fR or \fBp\fR"
Interrupt-driven or polled.
.IP "\fBf\fR or \fBn\fR"
RTS-CTS flow control or no hardware flow control.
.PP
For details of what the options mean, see the Lexicon article for the
device driver
.BR asy .
.PP
Suffix letters ``rlipnf'' respectively indicate
remote, local, interrupt, polled, no-flow, and flow-control configurations,
as explained in the Lexicon article for
.BR asy .
.PP
For each question,
type the value that applies or press
.BR <Enter> ,
to select the default displayed in brackets.
The option
