.TH quot "" "" Command
.PC "Summarize file-system usage"
\fBquot [ \-c ] [ \-f ] [ \-n ] [ \-t ] \fIfilesystem\fR
.PP
.HS
.SH Options:
.IC \fB\-c\fR
Print file size, number of files of size,
and cumulative total blocks up to size
.IC \fB\-f\fR
Print number of files plus number of blocks per user
.IC \fB\-n\fR
Input (i-number, file system) pairs one per line;
output owners and file names (e.g.: \fBncheck fs | sort +0n | quot -n fs\fR)
.IC \fB\-t\fR
Print totals (where applicable)
.Pp
Options \fB\-c\fR and \fB\-n\fR are disjoint from other options.
Only the superuser \fBroot\fR can run \fBquot\fR.
.HE
.B quot
produces several different summaries about the ownership of
files for each
.I filesystem
argument given.
When no options are specified,
.B quot
produces a two-column listing that gives the amount of space
used by each user, sorted in decreasing order of file space used;
the first column gives the number of blocks used and the second
gives the use name.
Space is always given in blocks.
.PP
Options are available to modify the normal output or specify a
completely different action.
.PP
.B quot
recognizes the following options:
.RS
.IP \fB\-c\fR 0.3i
Give a three-column breakdown of files by size.
The first column contains all file sizes, in increasing order.
The second column gives the number of files of the size
indicated in the first.
The third gives a cumulative sum of the sizes of all files less than
or equal to the current size.
.IP \fB\-f\fR
Add an initial column that contains the number of files to the front of the
normal output.
.IP \fB\-n\fR
Takes as input a list of i-numbers and file names, one per line and sorted in
ascending order by i-number; ignore all lines not in this form.
The output is in two columns:
the first gives the owner and the second contains the file name for each entry
in the output.
This conforms to usage with the following pipeline:
.ID
	ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot \-n filesystem
.IE
.IP \fB\-t\fR
To the normal output, add a line that contains totals.
.PP
.B quot
runs much faster with a raw device for
.IR filesystem .
.PP
Only the superuser
.B root
can run
.BR quot .

.SH Notes
Sparse files are recorded as if they had all of their blocks allocated.
