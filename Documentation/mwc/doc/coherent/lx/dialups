The \*(CO system lets you force classes of users who log in through particular
devices to enter an extra password.
This helps you protect your system against people
who may be try to penetrate it via modem.
.PP
The file
.B /etc/dialups
names every device that may require an additional password.
Each device must be named on its own line; for example:
.DM
	/dev/com1l
	/dev/com3l
	/dev/com3r
.DE
.PP
When a device is named in
.BR /etc/dialups ,
.B login
looks in file
.B d_passwd
to see if a password has been linked to user's default shell.
This permits you, for example, to ask for an extra password
for all users who attempt to log in remotely and who have an
interactive shell, while letting \*(UU accounts enter without the
extra password.
For examples, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR d_passwd .
