.HE
For the typesetting program
.B troff
to use a font, it must know the width of each character in the font,
and it must know how to tell the printer to select the font.
All of this information is built into a \fIfont-width table\fR, which
.B troff
reads when you run it.
.PP
\*(CO comes with font-width tables for a selected set of fonts:
for a handful of scalable fonts that are included with standard PostScript
cartridges, for a few bit-mapped fonts, and for some fonts that are
built into the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III.
For a list of the font-width tables that are included with \*(CO, and for
further information on how to manage fonts, see
the Lexicon entry for
.BR troff .
.PP
The command
.B fwtable
can read a font, and build a new font-width table for it.
It reads the font information from
.I infile
(or the standard input)
and writes a font-width table for the font to
.I outfile
(or the standard output).
It can understand fonts in the following formats:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
.II PCL
.II .usp
PCL (Printer Control Language) bitmap fonts, which have
the suffix
.BR .usp .
.IP \(bu
.II .tfm
Fonts that are built into the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III and IV,
which have the suffix
.BR .tfm .
.IP \(bu
.II .afm
.II AFM
AFM (Adobe Font Metric) descriptions of PostScript fonts, which
have the suffix
.BR .afm .
.PP
.B fwtable
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-p\fR 0.3i
.I infile
is an AFM (Adobe Font Metric) description for a PostScript font.
By default,
.B fwtable
assumes that
.I infile
is a a bit-mapped soft font (that is, a font with the suffix
.BR .usp ).
.IP
Please note that if the AFM font you will be using is downloadable
rather than built into a cartridge, you must also use the command
.B PSfont
to ``cook'' that font's
.B .pfb
file into downloadable form.
For more information, see the Lexicon entry
.BR PSfont .
.IP \fB\-t\fR
.I infile
is a Hewlett-Packard \fB.tfm\fR file, which describes a font
that is built into the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III, rather than a bit-mapped
soft font.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Print a brief font description to the standard error file.
