The file

names the services provided by TCP/IP and related protocols.
.PP
Each line within this file describes one services.
A line consists of four fields, which respectively give the
official service name, well-known port number by which it is accessed,
the name of its protocol, and any aliases by which it is known.
For example:
.DM
	smtp            25/tcp            mail
	time            37/tcp            timserver
	time            37/udp            timserver
.DE
.PP
Fields are separated by white space, with the exception of fields
that give the port and the protocol name; these are separated by virgule `/'.
The fourth, aliases field is optional.
A pound-sign character `#' introduces a comment; all text from that character
to the end of the line is ignored.
