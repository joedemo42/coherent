.HE
The command
.B zmore
is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
.I file
is a text file; the operator
.B \-
tells
.B more
to read and display the standard input.
.PP
Unlike the command
.BR more ,
.BR zmore
can display the contents of compressed files.
It works on files compressed with the commands
.B compress
or
.BR gzip ,
as well as on files that are uncompressed.
If it cannot find
.IR file ,
.B zmore
looks for a file of the same name that has any of the suffices
.BR .gz ,
.BR .z ,
or
.BR .Z .
.PP
.B zmore
recognizes the same command-line options as
.BR more ,
and recognizes the same commands.
For details, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR more .
