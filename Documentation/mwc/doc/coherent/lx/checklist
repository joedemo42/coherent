.II "boottime, check file system"
The file
.B /etc/checklist
names all \*(CO partitions on your hard disk.
\*(CO executes
.B fsck
for each file named in this file.
This ensures that the file-system of each partition is checked and cleaned
before it is mounted.
.PP
When you add a new \*(CO partition to your system, you should insert
its name (that is, the name of its raw device) into
.B /etc/checklist
to ensure that its file system is checked at boot time.
