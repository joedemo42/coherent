tests whether

but excluding the space character.
The ANSI Standard defines a printable character as any character
that occupies one printing position on an output device.
.I c
must be a value that is representable as an
.B "unsigned char"
or
.BR EOF .
.PP
.B isgraph()
returns nonzero if
.I c
is a printable character (except for space), and zero if it is not.
