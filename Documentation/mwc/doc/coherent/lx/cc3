.TH cc3 "" "" Definition
.PC
.PP
.B cc3
is the output phase of the \*(CO C compiler.
It writes a file of assembly language rather than a relocatable object module.
This phase is optional; it allows you to examine the code
generated by the compiler.
To produce an assembly-language output of a C program,
use the \fB\-S\fR option on the
.B cc
command line.
For example,
.DM
	cc -S foo.c
.DE
.PP
tells
.B cc
to produce a file of assembly language called \fBfoo.s\fR,
instead of an object module.
