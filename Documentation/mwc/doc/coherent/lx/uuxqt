\fBuuxqt\fR
.PP
.B uuxqt
reads files from directory
\fB/usr/spool/uucp/\fIsitename\fR, and executes them.
It recognizes the files to execute (as opposed to the files that
simply contain data, such as mail messages) because they are prefixed
with the string ``X.''.
.B uuxqt
executes only the programs for which the remote system has permission.
.PP
.B uuxqt
is invoked by either
.B uucp
or
.BR uucico .

.IP "\fB\-I \fIfile\fR"
Read configuration information from

instead of from

Log each
.IR activity ;
