.PP
.B LIBPATH
names the directories that hold the phases of the \*(CO C
compiler, the run-time start-up modules, and libraries.
.B cc
searches these directories
as it orchestrates the compiling and linking of a program written in
C or assembly-language.
.PP
A typical definition is:
.DM
	export LIBPATH=:/lib:/usr/lib
.DE
.PP
This searches the current directory `.', then
.BR /lib ,
then
.BR /usr/lib .
.PP
If you have not set
.B LIBPATH
in your
.BR .profile ,
.B cc
uses the default
.B LIBPATH
that is set in header file
.BR path.h .
This definition is adequate for all standard installations of \*(CO.
