.TH "sticky bit" "" "" Definition

.PP
The
.I "sticky bit"
is one of the mode bits associated with a file.
If the sticky bit is set for an executable file and swapping is enabled,
\*(CO behaves in a special way when it executes that file.
.PP
When the \*(CO system executes the file the first time, all
proceeds normally.
When the program exits, however, the pure segments are left on the
swap device; when the program is re-invoked,
\*(CO reads \*(QLpure\*(QR code (text) areas from the swap
device and all other (impure) segments from the file system.
This speeds execution of large programs that are executed frequently.
.PP
This strategy works well on systems that have large swap devices.
Because overuse of the sticky bit would quickly swamp the swap device,
only the superuser can set the sticky bit.
