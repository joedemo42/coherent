.PP
The command
.B cancel
cancels execution of a printing job.
It recognizes the following options:
.IP \fB\-all\fR 0.75i
Cancel all requests that are currently executing.
.IP \fIjob\fR
Cancel each
.IR job .
Each
.I job
is identified by the number printed by
.B lp
when the job was first spooled.
.PP
When a job is cancelled, it remains in the print queue for the remainder of
its ``lifetime'', and may be printed later.
When it cancels a job,
.B cancel
sends mail to the owner of the job to notify him of the job's cancellation.
.PP
.B cancel
does not affect jobs that have already been downloaded into their destination
printers.
The only way to stop a job from printing after it has been downloaded is
to clear the printer's memory.
See the documentation that came with your printer for instructions on how to
do that.
