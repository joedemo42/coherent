The command
.B hash
lets you manipulate the Korn shell's hashing facility.
A hashed command can be accessed instantly by the shell,
without the delay of searching the directories in the \fBPATH\fR
environmental variable.
.PP
When called with an argument,
.B hash
prints all hashed commands.
When called with one or more
.I command
arguments, it adds
.I command
to its hash table.
The option \fB\-r\fR removes
.I command
from the hash table.
.PP
Note that before you can use hashing, you must use the
.B set
command to turn it on.
For more information on the Korn shell's
hashing feature, see the Lexicon entry for
.BR ksh .
