.TH "structure assignment" "" "" "Definition"
.PC
.PP
\*(KR forbids structure assignment, the passing of structures to functions,
and returning structures from functions (as opposed to the
passing or returning of \fIpointers\fR to structures).
The \*(PN C compiler lifts these restrictions.
.PP
Some C compilers transform structure arguments and structure
returns into structure pointers.
Note that the use of
structure assignment, structure arguments, or structure returns may
create problems when porting the code to another C compiler.

Because this feature deviates from the description
of the C language found in the first edition of
.I "The C Programming Language"
compiling with the
.B \-VSBOOK
option will flag all points where it occurs in your program.
