.PP
The kernel invokes a driver's
.B halt
routine when the system is shut down.
The driver should not assume that interrupts are enabled.
It should ensure that its device has no more interrupts pending,
and it should inform its device to generate no more interrupts.
.PP
After the
.B halt
routine is called, no more calls can be made to the driver's entry points.
