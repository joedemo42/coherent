Under the internal \*(CO device-driver interface,
the entry point
.B poll
gives access to the driver's routine for polling the device.
The address of this routine is given in field
.B c_poll
of the driver's
.B CON
structure.
.PP
By convention, the
.B poll
routine is named with the word
.B poll
prefixed with your driver's unique prefix.
This, however, is not required.
.PP
.I device
identifies the device to be polled.
.PP
.I events
gives the number of events to be polled.
.PP
.I msec
gives the number of seconds to wait before the call times out.
.PP
Finally,
.I private
points to a data item that is private to this driver.
Note that most drivers do not use this argument.
