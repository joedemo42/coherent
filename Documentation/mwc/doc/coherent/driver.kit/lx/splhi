.B splhi()
sets the interrupt priority to the highest level,
i.e., it blocks all interrupts.
It returns the previous priority level.
For information on how the
.B spl
family of functions relate to each other, see the entry for

.SH Notes
.B splhi()
has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.
.PP
A driver can hold a
driver-defined sleep locks across a call to this function.
It can also hold driver-defined basic lock or read/write lock;
however, the call to
.B splhi()
must not lower the level of interrupt priority
below that associated with the lock.
.PP
Interrupt-level code must never lower the level of interrupt priority
below that at which the interrupt handler was entered.
