.B busyWait2()
repeatedly calls the function to which \fIfn\fR points.
It returns when
.I fn
returns a non-zero value, or after
.I ticks
timer ticks have elapsed, whichever happens first.
If
.I fn
is NULL,
.B busyWait2()
waits unconditionally.
.PP
.B busyWait2()
differs from the call
.B busyWait()
in that its granularity is finer:
one count equals 1/(11932*\fBHZ\fR) seconds, or about 0.84 microseconds.
.PP
.B busyWait2()
returns one if \fIfn\fR returned a nonzero value,
or zero if it has timed out.
