Function
.B untimeout()
cancels the request to execute a given function at a future time.
It returns nothing.
.PP

.I function_id
identifies the request to cancel;
it had been returned to
.B itimeout()
when the function was first scheduled for execution.
.PP
If you call
.B untimeout()
as the function is running,
.B untimeout()
does not return until the function has run to completion.

.SH Notes
.B untimeout()
has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.
Note that
.B untimeout()
can be executed only from an interrupt level
less than or equal to the level that
.B itimeout()
specified when it scheduled the function to be executed.
.PP
A driver cannot hold a driver-defined basic lock,
read/write lock, or sleep lock
across a call to this function if that lock is being contended by
the scheduled function.
.PP
Note that the scheduled function cannot call
.B untimeout()
to cancel itself.
