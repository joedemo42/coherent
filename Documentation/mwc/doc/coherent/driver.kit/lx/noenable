.B noenable()
stops functions
.BR insq() ,
.BR putbq() ,
and
.B putq()
from scheduling the service routine of
.I queue
when they enqueue a message that does not have high priority.
.B noenable()
does not stop these functions from enabling
.IR queue 's
service routine when they enqueue a high-priority message,
nor does it stop the service routine from being enabled when a function calls
.B qenable()
explicitly.
