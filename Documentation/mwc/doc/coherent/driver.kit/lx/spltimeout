.B spltimeout()
sets the interrupt priority to the level associated with timeout
functions, i.e., all functions scheduled by the function
.BR itimeout() .
It returns the previous priority level.
For information on how the
.B spl
family of functions relate to each other, see the entry for
.BR splbase() .

.SH Notes
.B spltimeout()
has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.
.PP
A driver can hold a
driver-defined sleep locks across a call to this function.
It can also hold driver-defined basic lock or read/write lock;
however, the call to
.B spltimeout()
must not lower the level of interrupt priority
below that associated with the lock.
.PP
Interrupt-level code must never lower the level of interrupt priority
below that at which the interrupt handler was entered.
