.B "#include <sys/stream.h>"
.PP
Each \*(ST driver or module has one
.B streamtab
structure that is statically allocated within its sources.
It must be named \fBprefix\fBinfo\fR, where
.I prefix
is the driver's magic prefix.
.PP
.B streamtab
contains the addresses of the
.B qinit
structures for the read and write queues of a driver or module.
The
.B qinit
structure, in turn, contains the addresses for the routines with which
a driver or module manages its queues.
.PP
The following fields in structure
.B streamtab
are available to the driver or module:
.IP "\fBstruct qinit *st_rdinit\fR"
.IS "\fBstruct qinit *st_wrinit\fR"
The addresses of, respectively, the read-side and write-side
.B qinit
structures.
.IP "\fBstruct qinit *st_muxrinit\fR"
.IS "\fBstruct qinit *st_muxwinit\fR"
The addresses of, respectively, the lower read-side and the lower write-side
.B qinit
structures for multiplexing drivers.
Modules and non-multiplexing drivers should initialize these to NULL.
