.B bzero()
initializes to zero
.I number
bytes of memory, beginning at
.IR address .
It returns nothing.
.PP
The block of memory described by
.I address
and
.I bytes
must lie within the kernel's address space and must reside in memory.
If
.I address
lies within user space, the driver can
corrupt the system in an unpredictable (and probably undesirable) way.

.SH Notes
.B bzero()
has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.
.PP
A function can hold
driver-defined basic locks, read/write locks, and sleep locks
across a call to this function.
.PP
This function is equivalent to the library routine
.BR memset() .
