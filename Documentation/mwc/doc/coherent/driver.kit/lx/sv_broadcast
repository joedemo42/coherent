.B SV_BROADCAST()
awakens every process blocked on the synchronization variable
.IR synch .
Because a synchronization variable is stateless, a call to
.B SV_BROADCAST()
affects only the processes now blocked on
.IR synch ,
not processes that may later block on it.

has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.

A driver can hold a
driver-defined basic lock, read/write lock, or sleep lock
across a call to this function.
