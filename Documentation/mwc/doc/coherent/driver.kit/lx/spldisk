sets the interrupt priority to the level associated with disk devices.
It returns the previous priority level.

.SH Notes
.B spldisk()
has base or interrupt level.
It does not sleep.
.PP
A driver can hold a
driver-defined sleep locks across a call to this function.
It can also hold driver-defined basic lock or read/write lock;
however, the call to
.B spldisk()
must not lower the level of interrupt priority
below that associated with the lock.
.PP
Interrupt-level code must never lower the level of interrupt priority
below that at which the interrupt handler was entered.
