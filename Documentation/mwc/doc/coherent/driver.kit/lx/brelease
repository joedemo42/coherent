unlocks and releases the buffer pointed to by \fIbp\fR.

A device driver built with the internal kernel routines must call
.B brelease()
when it no longer needs a buffer obtained via a \fBbread()\fR.
If a driver mus read and modify a block,
the recommended sequence is for it to call \fBbread()\fR, modify the block,
set the
.B BFMOD
bit in the field \fBb_flag\fR field, then call \fBbrelease()\fR.
