.B sigdump()
writes a dump of the current process into file \fIcore\fR
in the current directory, and terminates the current process.
.PP
.B sigdump()
writes its core file in the following way:
.IP \(bu 0.3i
All segments appearing in the core file have
.B SRFDUMP
flags set to one, and will be complete (never truncated).
.IP \(bu
All missing segments have
.B SRFDUMP
flags set to zero.
.IP \(bu
Any segment larger (in bytes) than
.B DUMP_LIM
will not appear in the core file.
.IP \(bu
If
.B DUMP_TEXT
is patched to one, the text segment will
appear in the core file (unless it is too big).
Thus, it is possible for a core file to contain text but no data.
