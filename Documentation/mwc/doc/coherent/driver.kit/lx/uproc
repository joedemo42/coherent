Structure
.B uproc
describes a process.
The kernel allocates one such structure for each process that is running.
Header file
.B <sys/uproc.h>
defines this structure.
.PP
.II "u area"
Each process has its own `u' (or ``user'') area.
This area holds a copy of the
.B uproc
structure, which the process (or things acting upon the process) can modify.
