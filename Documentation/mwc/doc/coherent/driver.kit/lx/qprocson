.SH Notes
.B qprocson()
has base level only.
It can sleep.
.PP
A driver cannot hold a
driver-defined basic lock or read/write lock across a call to this function.
However, it can hold a driver-defined sleep lock.
.PP
The caller cannot have the stream frozen when it calls this function.
.PP
The
.B open
routine within a driver or module must call
.B qprocson()
when it (the routine) is first invoked \(em
but only after it has allocated and intialized all resources upon which the
.B put
and
.B service
routines depend.
