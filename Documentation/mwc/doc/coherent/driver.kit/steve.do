Got it, no problem, it's printing as I write this, comments to follow.
Near top of page 2, "devic" -> "device".
The list of contents on p. 2 lists character followed by block,
the pagenation on the printed pages is the reverse.
More comments to follow...

DDK 4.2 doc typos in PS .out received 1/6/94:

Intro.
p. 1: subheading "Changes...": to my eye, this is too close to the
preceding paragraph, can it be given more space without much ado?
p. 2 l. 3: devic -> device
p. 2: list items #4, #5 should be #5, #4 to correspond with pagenation.

Kernel.
p. 4 l. 10: "a copy of the structure (bf)BUF," -> "a (bf)BUF structure,".
p. 6 # 5 table: "dmacpu" "chanid" "-1-1" are run-on, did you run out of
tab stops or was the last one not set?  [Maybe use an indent if you need
to squeeze out one more tab stop.]

Writing.

Block.

Character.

Lexicon.
