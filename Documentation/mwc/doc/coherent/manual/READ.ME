This directory contains the "Run" scripts from which the Coherent manual
is built:

	Run.manual - build the entire manual
	Run.conindex - build the table of contents and the index
	Run.lex - build a batch of Lexicon entries
	Run.misc - build miscellaneous pages (preface, copyright, etc.)
	Run.text - build a tutorial

	fonts.r - name fonts used in the manual
	top.r - macros used in the manual

Please note that "top.r" is also used by most of the other documentation
packages.
