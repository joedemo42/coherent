.B hypercube
displays a wireframe projection of a hypercube,
which rotates at user-specified rate around any or all of its four axes.
.PP
.B hypercube
recognizes the following options:
.IP "\fB\-color\fIN\fR \fIcolor\fR"
Draw face
.I N
of the cube in
.IR color .
.I N
must be an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
As the cube is drawn as a wire frame,
some faces have only two of their border-lines drawn in
.IR color ,
and some have all four.
.IP "\fB\-delay \fImicroseconds\fR"
Delay
.I microseconds
between steps of the animation.
The default is 100,000, or about 1/10th of a second.
.IP \fB\-mono\fR
Map the application to black and white, even if run on a color server.
.IP "\fB\-observer-z \fIint\fR"
Set the observer
.I int
units from the cube's center, one unit per side.
The default is five.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Draw the application on the root window.
.IP \fB\-window\fR
Draw the application on a newly-created window.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-xw \fIradians\fR"
.IS "\fB\-xy \fIradians\fR"
.IS "\fB\-xz \fIradians\fR"
.IS "\fB\-yw \fIradians\fR"
.IS "\fB\-yz \fIradians\fR"
.IS "\fB\-zw \fIradians\fR"
With each frame of the animation, rotate the cube
.I radians
around the specified axis.
.I radians
should be a small
radiansing-point value; a value less than 0.05 works best.
The defaults are
.BR xy=0.01 ,
.BR xz=0.005 ,
and
.BR yw=0.01 .
.SH "Environmental Variables"
.B hypercube
reads the following environmental variables:
.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
The default host and display number.
.IP \fBXENVIRONMENT\fR
The name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the property
.BR RESOURCE_MANAGER .
