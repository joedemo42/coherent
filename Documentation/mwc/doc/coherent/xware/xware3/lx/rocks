.B rocks
animates an asteroid field moving past the observer.
Sometimes the observer spins on Z axis.
.B rocks
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-count \fIinteger\fR"
Draw no more than
.I integer
asteroids on the screen at once.
The default is 100.
.IP "\fB\-delay \fImicroseconds\fR"
Delay
.I microseconds
between frames of the animation.
The default is 50,000, which equals about about 1/20th of a second.
.IP \fB\-norotate\fR
Do not rotate the observer:
just fly straight through the asteroid field.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Draw the application on the root window.
.IP "\fB\-speed \fIinteger\fR"
Set to
.I integer
the speed with which the asteroids fly past the observer.
.I integer
must be from one (slowest) to 100 (fastest), which is the default.
If your display looks jerky, try slowing down the rocks or reducing the
number of rocks.
.IP \fB\-window\fR
Draw the application on a newly-created window.
This is the default.
.SH "Environmental Variables"

.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
