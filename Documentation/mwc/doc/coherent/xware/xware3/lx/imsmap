If set,
.B imsmap
performs colormap cycling.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-iterations \fIinteger\fR"
Set the resolution of the image to
.IR integer ,
which is between zero and seven.
The default is seven.
.IP "\fB\-mode [hue|saturation|value|random]\fR"
This option selects the axis upon which colors are
interpolated between the foreground
and background color.
The default is
.BR random .
.IP \fB\-mono\fR
Map the application to black and white, even if run on a color server.
.IP "\fB\-ncolors \fIinteger\fR"
Use
.I integer
colors; the default is 50.
.IP \fB\-no\-cycle\fR
If set,
.B imsmap
does not perform colormap cycling.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Draw the application on the root window.
.IP "\fB\-timeout \fIseconds\fR"
Delay
.I seconds
between images;
the default is ten.
.IP \fB\-window\fR
Draw the applcation on a newly-created window.
This is the default.
