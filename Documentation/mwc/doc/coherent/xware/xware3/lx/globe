The program
.B globe
generates the globe of an imaginary planet.
It reads the data that comprise a square map of a planet, wraps the map around
a sphere, and rotates the sphere.
.SH "What Does globe Do?"
Given a square map \(em for example, one produced by \fBtec\fR \(em
.B globe
shows what that planety would look like from space.
Because a square is flat and a sphere is round, some distortion is involved.
.SH "How Do I Run It?"
To run
.BR globe ,
type its name followed by the name of the file that holds map of the world
whose globe you want
.B globe
to generate.
.PP
The file
.B /usr/X11/lib/planetge/globe.in
contains an example of such a map.
To display it, type the command:
.DM
	globe /usr/X11/lib/planetge/globe.in

.PP
After you invoke
.BR globe ,
be patient.
It may take the program as long as a few minutes to compute the globe from
the map data.
.PP
When
.B globe
runs, it opens a graphics screen.
There are 18 frames in the animation.
Colors indicate altitute, with the blue end of the spectrum being low and
the red end being high.
Thus, oceans are bright purple, whereas mountains are orange or red.
.PP
To end the animation and close the window, type `Q'.
.B globe
also stops automatically after 10,000 steps (a fairly long time).
