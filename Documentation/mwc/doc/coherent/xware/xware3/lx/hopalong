.B hopalong
generates real plane fractals, as described in the September 1986 issue of
.IR "Scientific American" .
It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fB\-count \fIinteger\fR"
Draw
.I integer
pixels before changing a color.
The default is 1,000.
.IP "\fB\-delay \fImicroseconds\fR"
Wait
.I microseconds
between drawing each pixel.
The default is zero.
.IP \fB\-mono\fR
Map the application to black and white, even if run on a color server.
.IP "\fB\-ncolors \fIinteger\fR"
Use
.I integer
colors, if possible.
The default is 100.
The selected colors cycle through the hue, making
.I N
stops around the color wheel.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Draw the application on the root window.
.IP "\fB\-timeout \fIseconds\fR"
Generate output for
.I seconds
before clearing the screen and starting over.
The default is 20 seconds.
.IP \fB\-window\fR
Draw the application on a newly created window.
This is the default.
