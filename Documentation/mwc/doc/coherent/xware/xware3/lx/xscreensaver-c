.B xscreen-c
lets you modify the behavior of
.B xscreensaver
even while it is running.
It recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-activate\fR
Turn on
.BR xscreensaver ,
as if the device had been idle long enough.
.IP \fB\-cycle\fR
Stops the current screensaving program and run a new one.
.IP \fB\-deactivate\fR
Turns off
.B xscreensaver
if it is on, as user input would.
.IP \fB\-demo\fR
Enter interactive demonstration mode.
.IP \fB\-exit\fR
Make
.B xcreensaver
exit.
This is slightly easier than killing the
.B xscreensaver
process.
.IP \fB\-lock\fR
This is the same as
.BR \-activate ,
but locks the device immediately.
.IP \fB\-next\fR
Like either
.B \-activate
or
.BR \-cycle ,
depending upon which is more appropriate,
except that the screen-saving program to be run is
the next one in
.BR xscreensaver 's
list, instead of a randomly chosen one.
This option is good for viewing all of the programs in place.
.IP \fB\-prev\fR
Like
.BR \-next ,
but views the previous program in the list rather than the next one.
.IP \fB\-restart\fR
Make
.B xscreensaver
exit and then restart with the same command-line arguments.
This is a good way of 
making
.B xscreensaver
re-read its resource data base.

.SH Notes
The \*(CO implementation of
.B xscreensaver
does not implement locking or demonstration mode.
Therefore, the options that refer to these features will do nothing.
