.B pyro
simulates fireworks, like a Macintosh program of the same name.
It recognizes the following options:
.IP "\fB\-count \fIinteger\fR"
Set to
.I integer
the number of particles that are displayed at any one time.
The default is 100.
.IP "\fB\-frequency \fIinteger\fR"
Set to
.I integer
the frequency with which new Roman candles should be launched.
The default is 30.
.IP \fB\-mono\fR
Map the application to black and white, even if run on a color server.
.IP \fB\-root\fR
Draw the application on the root window.
.IP "\fB\-scatter \fIinteger\fR"
Set to
.I integer
the number of particles into which a Roman candle should disintegrate.
The default is 20.
The actual number used is between
.I integer
and \fIinteger\fB+(\fIinteger\^\fB/2)\fB.
.IP \fB\-window\fR
Draw the application on a newly-created window.
This is the default.
.SH "Environmental Variables"
.B pyro

.IP \fBDISPLAY\fR
