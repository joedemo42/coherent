is a version of the game ``Spy vs. Spy'' from the Apple ][.
In it,
you control the Spy (the pink figure) who is trying to escape the building.
The \fBBoB\fRs (the blue, pipe-smoking figures)
in the elevators are trying to stop him.
You have to maneuver your spy from one end of the corridor to the other
while dodging the Bob's.
If the spy makes it to the end of the corridor, he moves up a level;
however, if a BoB strikes the spy, the spy is flattened.
The goal is to move all the way up the building before time runs out.
Any leftover time is added to your score as a bonus.
.PP
The BoB's change speed each time they change direction.
On each ledge some
.B SLACK
appears after a random delay.
Picking this up is worth 500 bonus points.
.PP
Once you reach the top, you start over at the bottom, one ledge higher.
The BoB's also travel a shorter route, so they bounce faster.
.SH Controls
You can control your spy with either the keyboard
or the mouse.
With the keyboard,
pressing `J' moves the spy to the left, pressing `K' moves him to the
right, and pressing the spacebar stops him.
With the mouse, pressing the left-mouse button moves the spy to the left,
while pressing any other button moves him to the right.
The spy moves as long as you hold down the button.
