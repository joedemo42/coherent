.II XPM
.II "X pixmap"
.B sxpm
displays any X pixmap (XPM), version 2 or 3.
You can also use it to convert a version-2 XPM into version-3 format.
.B sxpm
reads the pattern to display from
.IR filename .
The
.I filename
`-' indicates the standard input.
To quit the program, type `Q'.
.SH "Command-line Options"
If you run
.B sxpm
with no command-line option, it displays a usage message and exits.
.B sxpm
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-c\fR
Use a private color map.
.IP \fB\-closecolors\fR
Try to use ``close colors'' before reverting to other visual forms.
.IP "\fB\-color\fR"
Use the colors specified for a color visual.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIdisplay\fR"
.B sxpm
displays the XPM on
.IR display .
.IP "\fB\-g \fIgeometry\fR"
Set the geometry of the window that
.B sxpm
opens.
If you do not specify a geometry on the command line,
.B sxpm
opens a window that is the size of the pixmap it has read.
You can, of course, use the buttons on the window frame to enlarge the
window;
.B sxpm
automatically tiles the enlarged window with the XPM.
.IP \fB\-grey\fR
Display the XPM on a gray-scale display.
Convert colors appropriately.
.IP \fB\-grey4\fR
Display the XPM on a four-tone gray-scale display.
Convert colors appropriately.
.IP \fB\-hints\fR
Set resource
.B ResizeInc
for the window.
.IP "\fB\-icon \fIfilename\fR"
Make the icon in
.IR filename
to the that used by
.BR sxpm .
This demonstrates how to use an XPM image as a color icon.
.IP \fB\-mono\fR
Display the XPM in monochrome.
Convert colors appropriately.
.IP \fB\-nod\fR
Do not display the XPM in a window.
This option is useful when you use
.B sxpm
to convert an XPM from version-2 format to version-3 format.
.IP "\fB\-o \fIfilename\fR"
Write the output into
.IR filename .
The
.I filename
`-' indicates the standard output.
.IP "\fB\-p \fIsymbol pixelvalue\fR"
Set the color of
.I symbol
to
.I pixelvalue
instead of its default color.
.IP \fB\-plaid\fR
Display the plaid XPM that is built into
.BR sxpm .
.IP "\fB\-rgb \fIdatabase\fR"
Search the color names in
.I database
and write them instead of their RGB values.
Note that the default color data base is in file
.BR /usr/X11/lib/rgb.txt .
.IP "\fB\-s \fIsymbol color\fR"
Set the color of
.I symbol
to
.IR color ,
instead of its default color.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Verbose option.
.B sxpm
writes a description of each action it takes to stderr.
.SH "Notes
When converting a file from XPM version2 to XPM version 3,
if several pixels (symbols) have the same color,
only one will be in the file written out.
.PP
Some window managers cannot use an XPM as an icon.
The window managers
.B fvwm 
and
.B fwm
can do so, however, if you compile them with the appropriate options.
For details, see the
.B Imakefile
that comes with these window managers.
