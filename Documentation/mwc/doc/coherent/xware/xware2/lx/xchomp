.PC "Run through a maze and evade ghosts"
\fBxchomp\fR
.PP
.B xchomp
is an X version of a popular video game.
The player by a circle attempts to evade four ``ghosts''
while ``eating'' dots from the playing-board maze.
.PP
At the beginning of a game, the four ghosts are in the
.I "ghost box"
above the center of the maze
and the player is below it.
The maze is filled with dots, including four large circles called
.IR "power pellets" .
The ghosts emerge from the ghost box and chase the player.
The console's arrow keys move the player left, right,
up, or down through the maze.
The player continues to move in the same direction until
a wall of the maze stops him or you press another arrow key.
.PP
When the player eats a power pellet,
he acquires super power and can chase the ghosts briefly;
if he catches a ghost, he receives bonus points and
the ghost returns to the ghost box temporarily.
Once a player eats all the dots on the board,
the game continues at the next level.
.PP
The lower left corner of the screen displays the number of
extra players remaining in the current game (initally two).
You get an extra player for every 10,000 points you score.
The game ends when the ghosts eat the last player.
.PP
To pause the game, press
.B <space>
or iconify the window.
If you press `R' while the game is paused, it aborts and returns you to the
title window.
From that window, you can either press `Q' to quit the game, or press any
other key to begin again.
.PP
Unlike the video game after which it was modelled,
.B xchomp
uses several different mazes.
The levels of the game are designated by symbols.
The first few levels are ``fruit'' levels \(em that is,
they are designated by little pictures of fruit on the bottom of the
.B xchomp
window.
For example, the first level is the ``cherry'' level.
Once in a while (twice on every level), the
symbol corresponding to the current level appears in the maze.
It appears for only a few seconds;
eating it adds points to your score.
The higher your level, the more points you get for eating the symbol.

.SH Notes
.B xchomp
recognizes no command-line options.
Because it does not use the Xt toolkit, you cannot modify its appearance by
setting standard resources.
.PP
On some faster machines, the game may run too quickly to be playable.
The only way to slow it down is to recompile it.
.PP
If you run
.B xchomp
with many other process that consume CPU cycles, its animation may be
jerky.
For best results, your system should be as quiet as possible.
