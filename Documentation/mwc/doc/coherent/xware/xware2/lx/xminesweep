.B xminesweep 
lets you play the game ``minesweeper''.
At the beginning of the game, you are presented with a grid of cells,
around which is randomly scattered a predetermined number of mines.
Your job is deduce which cells contain the mines and flag them.
If you deduce all of the mined cells correctly, you win.
.PP
To guess that cell contains a mine, click on it with the right-mouse button.
.B xminesweep
draws a danger buoy on that cell to show that you think it has a mine.
If you click the right-mouse button on a cell that is buoyed,
.B xminesweep
un-buoys it.
This lets you change your mind about whether a cell contains a mine.
When you have buoyed as many cells as there are mines, the game is over;
if you have buoyed a cell that does not contain a mine, you lose.
.PP
To guess that a cell does
.I not
contain a mine, click on it with the left-mouse button.
If that cell contains a mine, you are blown up and the game is over.
If that cell does not contain a mine but neighbors on or more cells
that do, then
.B xminesweep
displays the number of neighboring cells that are mined.
If that cells does not contain a mine and does not neighbor on a cell
that contains a mine, then
.B xminesweep
exposes all adjacent cells that do not contain mines.
.PP
The following figure shows the
.B xminesweep
window in mid-game:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/xminesweep.eps
Note the cells that are buoyed.
The numbers within selected cells give the number of neighboring cells
that contain mines; you can use this information to deduce
which cells contain mines.
.PP
At the top of the
.B xminesweep
window are two buttons:
one labelled
.B Quit
the other labelled
.BR Restart .
Clicking on the former ends the game and closes the
.B xminesweep
window; clicking on the latter starts a new game.
.PP
The top of the window also gives the total number of mines, and the
number of buoys you have left to plant.
.PP
When the game ends,
.B xminesweep
exposes all cells.
It marks all buoyed cells that did not contain mines, and shows all of
the mines that you missed.
.SH "Command-line Options"
.B xminesweep
recognizes the standard Athena Widget command-line options.
It also recognizes the following options:
.IP "\fB\-mines \fInumber\fR"
Use
.I number
mines.
.IP "\fB\-ncH \fInumber\fR"
Make the grid
.I number
cells high.
.IP "\fB\-ncW \fInumber\fR"
Make the grid
.I number
cells wide.
.SH Resources
In addition to the standard Athena Widget resources,
.B xminesweep
accepts the special resources
.BR XMinesweep*mines ,
.BR XMinesweep*numCellsHigh ,
and
.BR XMinesweep*numCellsWide .
These correspond, respectively, to the command-line options
.BR \-mines ,
.BR \-ncH ,
and
.BR \-ncW .
