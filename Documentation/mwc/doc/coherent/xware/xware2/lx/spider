.PP
.B spider
is a particularly challenging game double-deck solitaire.
Unlike most
solitaires, it provides extraordinary opportunities for the skillful player
to overcome bad luck in the deal by means of careful analysis and complex
manipulations.
.PP
This program
does not actually play the game for you;
rather, it takes the place of the cards (by displaying the tableau on the
screen), and keeps a record of the game so that you can follow out long
lines of play without losing track of where you started from.
.PP
.BR spider ,
when compiled with XView has a property sheet for defining resources.
The property sheet is on the
.B File
menu item.
To be sure spot help is active,
set the environment variable
.B HELPDIR
(for
.B XView
version 1.0.1) or
.B HELPPATH
(for
.B XView
version 2.0 or later) to the directory that contains the file
spider.info file.
For details,
see ``spot help'' on the property sheet.
.SH Options
The program
.B spider
recognizes the following command-line option
\fB\-save_file\fR,
which names the file into which you have saved an unfinished game.
.SH Resources
.B spider
recognizes all of the core X Toolkit resource names and classes.
In addition, it recognizes the following:
.IP "\fBbell (\fRclass\fB Bell)\fR"
This Boolean resource specifies whether 
.B spider
uses the bell to complain about illegal moves.
The default is
.BR true .
.IP "\fBconfirm (\fRclass\fB Confirm)\fR"
This Boolean resource specifies whether 
.B spider
asks for confirmation before certain actions.
The default is
.BR true .
.IP "\fBreplayTime (\fRclass\fB ReplayTime)\fR"
This resource gives the number of microseconds to pause between each move when
showing a replay.
The default is 200.
.IP "\fBroundsCards (\fRclass\fB RoundCards)\fR"
This resource specifies whether to use cards with rounded corners.
Rounded cards look better, but are considerably slower.
The default is
.BR on .
.IP "\fBdeltaMod (\fRclass\fB DeltaMod)\fR"
This specifies the interval at which to recalulate the inter-card spacing.
The default is one, which means the card stacks are resized every time
they grow or shrink when when they near the bottom of the table.
Setting this to a higher value cuts down on the number of redraws
by limiting visibility when it is unnecessary.
.IP "\fBsquish" (\fRclass\fB Squish)\fR"
This specifies whether to use a different card layout.
This layout saves on screen space, but can also be somewhat confusing.
The default is
.BR off .
.IP "\fBhelpDir (\fRclass\fB HelpDir)\fR"
This resource gives the default directory in which
.B spider
looks for help files.
