The game
.B xhextris
is an implementation of the Russian game ``Tetris'', except that it builds
its shapes out of hexadecimal blocks rather than squares.
As a result, the variety of shapes is much greater than with Tetris.
Otherwise, the rules are the same as with Tetris.
For details on how to play the game, see the Lexicon entry for
.B xtetris
in the manual for X Windows for \*(CO.
