.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwish\fR ?\fIoptions\fR? ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 15
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-file \fIfileName\fR" 15
Read commands from \fIfileName\fR rather than standard input.  The
last element in \fIfileName\fR will be used as the title for the
application and name of its interpreter for \fBsend\fR
commands (unless overridden by the \fB\-name\fR option\fR).
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 15
Initial geometry to use for window.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 15
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 15
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBWish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands
from standard input or from a file.
It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.
If \fBwish\fR is invoked with no \fB\-f\fR option then it
reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input.
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.
.VS
If there exists a file \fB.wishrc\fR in the home directory of
the user, \fBwish\fR evaluates the file as a Tcl script
just before reading the first command from standard input.
.VE
.PP
If the \fB\-file\fR option is provided to Tk, then \fBwish\fR reads Tcl
commands from the file named in the \fB\-file\fR option.  These
commands will normally create an interactive interface consisting
of one or more widgets.  When the end of the command file is
reached, \fBwish\fR will continue to respond to X events until
all windows have been deleted.
.VS
There is no automatic evaluation of \fB.wishrc\fR in this
case, but the script file can always \fBsource\fR it if desired.
.VE

.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBWish\fR sets the following Tcl variables:
.TP 15
\fBargc\fR
Contains a count of the number of \fIarg\fR arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
.TP 15
\fBargv\fR
Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the \fIarg\fR arguments (not
including the options described above), in order, or an empty string
if there are no \fIarg\fR arguments.
.TP 15
\fBargv0\fR
.VS
Contains \fIfileName\fR if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which \fBwish\fR was invoked.
.TP 15
\fBtcl_interactive\fR
Contains 1 if \fBwish\fR is reading commands interactively (no
\fB\-file\fR option was specified and standard input is a terminal-like
device), 0 otherwise.
.VE

.SH "SCRIPT FILES"
.PP
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
.DS
\fB#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f
.DE
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if
you mark it as executable.
This assumes that \fBwish\fR has been installed in the default
location in /usr/local/bin;  if it's installed somewhere else
then you'll have to modify the above line to match.

.SH PROMPTS
.PP
.VS
When \fBwish\fR is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with ``\fB% \fR''.  You can change the prompt by setting the
variables \fBtcl_prompt1\fR and \fBtcl_prompt2\fR.  If variable
\fBtcl_prompt1\fR exists then it must consist of a Tcl script
to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt \fBwish\fR
will evaluate the script in \fBtcl_prompt1\fR.
The variable \fBtcl_prompt2\fR is used in a similar way when
a newline is typed but the current command isn't yet complete;
if \fBtcl_prompt2\fR isn't set then no prompt is output for
incomplete commands.
