.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBframe\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a frame widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
or in the option database
to configure aspects of the frame such as its background color
and relief.  The \fBframe\fR command returns the
path name of the new window.
.PP
A frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a
spacer or container for complex window layouts.  The only features
of a frame are its background color and an optional 3-D border to make the
frame appear raised or sunken.
.PP
In addition to the standard options listed above, a \fB\-class\fR
option may be specified on the command line.  If it is specified, then
the new widget's class will be set to \fIclassName\fR instead of
\fBFrame\fR.  Changing the class of a frame widget may be useful
in order to use a special class name in database options referring
to this widget and its children.  Note:  \fB\-class\fR is handled
differently than other command-line options and cannot be specified
using the option database (it has to be processed
before the other options are even looked up, since the new class
name will affect the lookup of the other options).  In addition,
the \fB\-class\fR option may not be queried or changed using the
\fBconfig\fR command described below.

.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
.PP
The \fBframe\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is the same as the path name of the frame's window.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIPathName\fR is the name of the command, which is the same as
the frame widget's path name.  \fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for frame widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? \fI?value option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBframe\fR
command.

.SH BINDINGS
.PP
When a new frame is created, it has no default event bindings:
frames are not intended to be interactive.

.SH KEYWORDS
frame, widget
