On page 1 of the release notes, it still has mention of the sources.  Can this
be removed, please?

The line about the addition of "GS_LIB" to /etc/profile should be re-worded
due to the fact that i am changing the installation routine to prompt the user
to do it automatically by appending the line to the end of the /etc/profile
after making a back-up of the file in /etc/profile.b4X6

On page 2, the section about source code, we provide the code for our 
busted implementation, we are shipping RTR binaries.  We should make mention
of that here instead of raven / MWCBBS.

On page 2, section: "Default Configuration" mentions that we don't support
alternate output devices.  We need to do something with this section since
if users do a "gs -?" they get a list of epson, hplj, etc, etc.  Plus, they
don't have the source to re-compile the package(s) any longer.

The section "Technical Supprt" mentions that "The sources in this package
have been test...."  These are binaries only.

Opps, the section on page 2, A final word, says "All of the source code for these
games, ...".  You may want to re-word this section since these are not games.
