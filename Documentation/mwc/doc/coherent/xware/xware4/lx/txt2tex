As of this writing (March 1994), LaTeX has not been ported to the
\*(CO operating system.
You can, however, copy the output of
.B txt2tex
to another system on which it is implemented.
.PP
.B txt2tex
sometimes fails to cutoff a full news header, especially if any unknown
text appears at the beginning of a line.
All further characters will be taken as raw text and
also appear in the LaTeX document.
For example, any kind of cross posting with comments
between the two news headers causes the second header to appear in the output.
