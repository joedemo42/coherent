\fBfig2ps2tex \fIfile\fR"
.PP
The script
.B fig2ps2tex
generates a TeX file for including a PostScript file in a TeX document.
This involves calculating the bounding box from the Postscript document.
The TeX inclusion file is written to stdout.
.PP
Note that the
.B psfig
macro package provides a more sophisticated approach to including
PostScript files in LaTeX docuements.
.B fig2ps2tex
works with plain TeX, however.
.SH Usage
Assume the Postscript file is called
.I foo.ps .
The command
.DM 
	fig2ps2tex foo.ps >foo.tex
.DE
.PP
creates the inclusion file with bounding information.
Then, include this file in your TeX document with the command
.DM
	\einput{foo}
.DE
.SH "See Also"

transfig,
xfig

.SH Notes
As of this writing (March 1994), TeX is not available for the \*(CO operating
system.
However, the output of this script can be downloaded to another system that
does support TeX.
