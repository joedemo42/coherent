.SH Notes
The \*(CO system does not include
.B pic
as part of its standard release.
However, the GNU package
.B groff
does include an implementation of
.BR pic .
As
.B groff
significantly departs from the standard \*(UN implementation of
.BR troff ,
it is not clear that this script will work with its version of
.BR pic :
