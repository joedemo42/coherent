.PC "Display a histogram of disk usage"
\fBdu \fIroot\fB | xdu\fR
.PP
The X application
.B xdu
reads the data returned by the \*(CO command
.BR du ;
then generates and displays a histogram that shows the amount of disk
space consumed by every directory.
.I root
names the directory from whence
.B du
measures disk usage.
.PP
.B xdu
displays a window that is divided into multiple columns:
the leftmost column displays directory
.IR root ;
as the columns progress from right to left, they go deeper into the
directory tree's hierarchy
The application draws a box for each directory.
The amount of vertical space that a box occupies is proportional
to the amount of disk space consumed by it and all of its children.
.B xdu
displays the name of a directory, should there be enough space within
its box.
.PP
You can move up or down the directory tree by clicking the left-mouse button
on a directory box.
If you select the leftmost box, the display
moves one level (assuming that the leftmost box does not already display
.IR root ).
If you select any other box,
.B xdu
moves it to the leftmost column of the window
and rescales the display appropriately.
To once again make directory
.I root
the leftmost column in the window,
either click the center-mouse button,
or typing `R'.
Clicking the right-mouse button, or typing `Q' exits the program.
