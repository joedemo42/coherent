.PP
.B xfilemanager
is a X11-based file manager
for \*(UN and related operating systems
(including Linux and \*(CO).
It features a graphical interface, and has ``Drag'n'Drop'' abilities.
.PP
When
.B xfilemanager
starts up, it displays either one large window that has an icon bar
and three sub-windows;
or two separate windows, of which one contains the icon bar and the other
contains the three sub-windows.
Of the three sub-windows, one is for the path;
one is for directories;
and the third is the work space.
Each is discussed in detail in the following sections.
.PP
The following picture shows
.B xfilemanager
in its two-window mode:
.PH 1 1 \*(XD/xfileman.eps
This picture shows three windows that are ``owned'' by
.BR xfilemanager :
the one labelled ``xfilemanager'', which shows the tree of the root directory;
the one labelled ``ws_shell'', which shows icons that can be used with
.BR xfilemanager ;
and the one labelled ``/v/fwb/doc'', which shows the contents of that directory.
Note that in the ``xfilemanager'' window,
the ``folder'' icon labelled ``/v/fwb/doc'' is drawn as opened; when you
click on a given directory or its ``folder'' icon,
.B xfilemanager
opens a separate window and displays the contents of that directory.
This is described in detail below.
.PP
The following sections describe each of
.BR xfilemanager 's
sub-windows.
.SH "Path Sub-Window"
The path sub-window shows the entire directory tree,
begining from a given root directory.
In the above image, this sub-window is displayed in the window labelled
``xfilemanager''.
.PP
If you do not specify a directory on
.BR xfilemanager 's
command line, by default it uses your
.B HOME
directory as the root directory.
Within this sub-window,
you can open a directory simply by clicking upon its name or icon.
You can open a directory into either of two modes:
.IP "\fIlocal mode\fR"
In this mode,
.B xfilemanager
inserts all subdirectories of this directory into the directory tree.
To open a directory into local mode, click once on its name or icon.
.IP "\fIfull mode\fR"
In this mode,
.B xfilemanager
inserts the entire contents of the directory into the directory tree.
To open a directory into full mode, double-click upon its name or icon.
.PP
If
.B xfilemanager
is using multiple windows,
it opens a new window and displays the contents of the directory in it,
as shown in the above picture.
If it is using one large window,
it displays the directory's contents within the central sub-window.
.SH "Directory Sub-Window"
The directory sub-window displays, depending on the current filtering method,
the whole contents of a directory.
In the above image, this sub-window is displayed in the window labelled
``/v/fwb/doc''.
.PP
Within this window, you can select a file for moving,
copying, deletion, etc., by clicking upon its icon or name,
then clicking upon one of the icons at the top of the window.
(These icons are described below.)
.PP
Double-clicking forces
.B xfilemanager
to execute a determined action, depending upon the type of the file;
for example, double-clicking upon a directory opens a new
directory window (or display the contents of this directory
in the directory sub-window).
.SH "Workspace Sub-Window"
The workspace sub-window
serves as a kind of container for executable files.
In the above image, this sub-window is shown in the window that is
labelled ``ws_shell''.
.PP
To add an executable program to this sub-window,
drag it from the directory sub-window into the workspace sub-window,
or click the button
.Kr Add_Workspace_Entry .
.SH "File Operations"
At the top of each window are a number of icons.
By clicking on one of these icons, you can invoke one of
.BR xfilemanager 's
built-in functions, as follows:
.IP \fBmove\fR
The icon that shows one picture being shifted to another invokes the
``move'' function.
This function resembles the \*(CO command
.BR mv .
.IP \fBdelete\fR
The icon that shows a file being dropped into a file invokes
.BR xfilemanager 's
delete function.
This function resembles the \*(CO command
.BR rm .
.IP \fBcopy\fR
The icon that shows a file with two arrows that point to two other files
invokes
.BR xfilemanager 's
``copy'' function.
This function resembles the \*(CO command
.BR cp .
.IP "\fBnew directory\fR"
The icon that shows a folder pointing to two other folders invokes
.BR xfilemanager 's
``new directory'' function.
This function resembles the \*(CO command
.BR mkdir .
.IP \fBstatus\fR
The icon that shows the letter `i' and a file invokes
.BR xfilemanager 's
``status'' function.
It resembles the \*(CO command
.BR "ls \-l" .
you can either press one of the buttons at the top of each window,
or drag files into the destination window or over the action buttons.
.PP
The picture at the right of the icon bar is an analogue clock that shows
the current time.
.SH "File Types"
As noted above,
.B xfilemanager
takes certain default actions, depending upon a file's given type.
.B xfilemanager
assigns a file to a given type by its suffix.
To determine which file belongs to which class of files,
edit the file
.BR $HOME/.xfmrc .
This file names the executables, the suffixes,
the icon file, and a short description.
.SH "Command-line Options"
.B xfilemanager
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP "\-rootDir \fIpath\fR"
Set to
.I path
the root directory of the path window.
The default is the user's
.B $HOME
directory.
.IP "\fB\-iconDir \fIpath\fR"
Set to
.I path
the directory that contains the file icons.
The default (under \*(CO) is
.BR /usr/X11/lib/xfilemanager .
.IP "\fB\-iconFont \fIfont\fR"
Use
.I font
to display the names of files.
The default is
.BR 8x13 .
.IP "\fB\-selectColor \fIcolor\fR"
Use
.I color
to mark selected files.
.IP "\fB\-doubleClickTime \fImilliseconds\fR"
Set to
.I milliseconds
the interval between clicks to mark a double-click.
If the interval between clicks is less than
.IR milliseconds ,
then
.B xfilemanager
regards the event as a double-click; otherwise, it regards the event
as two single clicks.
The default is 300 milliseconds.
.IP "\fB\-multiWindow\fR"
Use a separate window for each directory.
.IP "\fB\-singleWindow\fR"
Use one big window instead of many little windows.
.IP "\fB\-saveWS\fR"
Save the workspace upon exiting.
.IP "\fB\-noDragCopyAsk\fR"
.IS "\fB\-noDragDeleteAsk\fR"
.IS "\fB\-noDragMoveAsk\fR"
.IS "\fB\-NoDragExecAsk\fR"
Prevent
.B xfilemanager
from displaying a dialogue box when you copy, remove, or move,
a file by dragging its icon.
