Prominant notice need be given about the reliance of some packages
on the Xware-1 package.  Some packages need those fonts.

Also, a section on tuning app-defaults files for monochrome usage would
be nice.  You can use Xpostit as an example.  The plaid background of the
main window obscures the window entirely on a monochrome system unless
you change the Plaid-Background (see XPostit as a reference) property.
