.B xcdplayer
is a graphical interface that controls the CD\-ROM drive
under the X Window System.
It lets you use your mouse to load a CD into your drive, select a
track, play it, stop playing, or otherwise manipulate the drive.
.PP
.B xcdplayer
can read previously stored information about CD titles and programs
from a specified directory, and load it into the player upon startup
or when a disk is changed.
You can name this directory either by setting an option on
.BR xcdplayer 's
command line,
by using a customized personal resource file,
or by setting the environment variable
.BR XCDINFODIR .
If none of these methods specifies a directory,
.B xcdplayer
looks in the current directory.
.SH "Command-line Options"
.B xcdplayer
recognizes all of the standard X Toolkit command-line options.
In addition, it recognizes the following options:
.IP "\fB\-cdInfoDir \fIpath\fR"
Read the directories named in
.I path
for CD-ROM information.
.I path
should consist of directory names separated by colons `:'.
.IP "\fB\-debug\fR"
Tell
.B xcdplayer
to display debugging messages during operation.
.IP "\fB\-device \fIdevice\fR"
Manipulate
.IR device .
This option is used chiefly with systems that have multiple CD\-ROMs.
.IP "\fB\-volBase \fIlevel\fR"
Set the bottom of the volume scale to
.IR level ,
which must be a value of from zero through 255.
The default level is 187.
.IP "\fB\-volPcent \fIfloat\fR"
Set to
.I float
the ratio of volume change (range, zero through 255)
to percent of scrollbar shown.
The default is \fB.267\fR.
Use this value with the option
.BR volBase .
.SH "Subwindows"
.B xcdplayer
contains the following subwindows:
.IP "\fBTitle Window\fR"
This window displays the title of the CD
(if stored or entered),
corresponding to the CD currently in the player.
.IP "\fBProgram Window\fR"
This panel pops up when you click the
.K Program
button.
It contains a viewport that displays the currently selected program,
and buttons with which you can select options and tracks on the CD.
To remove this panel,
click the
.K Cancel
button.
.SH Buttons
.B xcdplayer
displays the following buttons:
.IP "\fK(audio)\fR"
Toggle the audio output, if possible.
.B xcdplayer

.IP "\fK(cycle)\fR"

the program will replay.
.IP "\fK(eject)\fR"
Eject the disk.
Clicking this button resets all modes.
.IP "\fK(fast-forward)\fR"
Fast-forward the disk.
If you hold down this button,

continues forwarding.
The amount of disk skipped during scanning and the length of

.BR scanPauseInterval .
If the disk is paused,
.B xcdplayer
skips the amount specifed by the resource
.BR pauseSkipInterval .

Clicking this button affects program selection.
.IP "\fK(play)\fR"
Enter play mode.
.IP "\fK(prev)\fR"
Return either to the beginning of the previous track,
or to the beginning of the current track, if more than
.B replayThreshold
seconds have elapsed.

is in program mode, clicking this button
reinvokes the previous program option.
.IP "\fK(program)\fR"
Enter program mode.
If the disk is paused, add the current track (if not zero) to the program.
It also pops up the
.B program
subwindow.
.IP "\fK(quit)\fR"
Exit
.BR xcdplayer .
This command leaves the disk in the last state you set.
.IP "\fK(rewind)\fR"
This resembles the button
.BR fast-forward ,
except that it moves backward on the disk rather than forward.

This button has no effect unless play mode is not active.
It is a toggle to program mode.

.B xcdplayer
reads this file whenever the current disk is placed into the player.
.IP "\fBSelections\fR"
You can click a selection displayed that is displayed in the viewport
of the program subwindow.
Clicking the currently selected track deletes it from the program.
The highlighted selection indicates the current insert/delete point in the

then click the program button again.

If
.B xcdplayer
is in program mode and not paused, this command toggles
to time remaining in program.
.IP "\fBtitle\fR"
Invoke a pop\-up dialogue for editing the title display.
To associate the title with that CD permanently,

.SH Notes
.B xcdplayer
cannot read the volume level and adjust the volume scroll
accordingly,
because there is not current support for this in the driver.
.PP
.B xcdplayer
occasionally ``hangs'' on a particular track, never quite reaching
the end of it.
To fix this problem, advance to the next or previous track, or press the
.K stop
button rectifies this condition.
