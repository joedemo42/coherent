.PC "Interactively manipulate X11 screen geometry"
\fBvgaset [\-d\fIclock\^\fB] [\-v] [\-s \fIsettings\^\fB]\fR
.PP
The command
.B vgaset
displays the current screen geometry in a
form similar to that used in a mode line in file
.BR Xconfig .
By issuing single-key commands,
you can modify in real time the screen's geometry,
thus enabling quick feedback for setting up optimal
values for the hardware in use.
You can also use
.B vgaset
to set initial values from its command line.
.PP
.B vgaset
recognizes the following command-line options:
.IP \fB\-d\fIclock\fR
Set to
.I clock
the speed of the dot clock being used.
This enables
.B vgaset
to print out timing information.
You can specify
.I clock
either in hertz or in megahertz.
.IP \fB\-s\fIsettings\fR
Give the values of horizontal-retrace start (HRS),
horizontal-retrace end (HRE), horizontal total (HT),
vertical-retrace start (VRS),
vertical-retrace end (VRE), and vertical total (VT)
to set initially.
For example, to set the values from the following mode line
.DM
	#                     HRS HRE HT      VRS VRE VT
	"640x480"  28	  640 680 728 776 480 480 482 494
.DE
.IP
use the command:
.DM
	vgaset -c28 -s"680 720 776 480 482 494"
.DE
Note that you
.I must
use this with the option
.B \-c
to set the clock whose video timings you are setting.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Print verbose information, in particular the contents of the CRTC registers.
.PP
Once you have invoked
.BR vgaset ,
you can issue the following one-key commands to manipulate the VGA settings:
.IS \fBB\fR
Increase the bottom margin.
.IS \fBb\fR
Decrease the bottom margin.
.IS \fBH\fR
Increase the horizontal sync pulse width.
.IS \fBh\fR
Decrease the horizontal sync pulse width.
.IS \fBI\fR
Turn interlace mode on (currently only Tseng 4000).
.IS \fBi\fR
Turn interlace mode off (currently only Tseng 4000).
.IS \fBL\fR
Increase the left margin.
.IP \fBl\fR
Decrease the left margin.
.IS \fBq\fR
Quit.
.IS \fBR\fR
Increase the right margin.
.IS \fBr\fR
Decrease the right margin.
.IS \fBT\fR
Increase the top margin.
.IS \fBt\fR
Decrease the top margin.
.IS \fBV\fR
Increase the vertical sync pulse.
.IS \fBv\fR
Decrease the vertical sync pulse.
.IS \fB?\fR
Reset to the initial values.
.IS \fB=\fR
Modify register contents directly.
.B vgaset
prompts you for the name of a CRTC register,
then displays its current value and prompts for a new one.
You can use this for more esoteric modifications.
.IS \*(RT
Redisplay the settings.
This can be useful after changing screen mode with
.B <ctrl><alt>+
or
.BR <ctrl><alt>- .
.IS <ctrl-D>
Quit.
.PP
After you issue a command,
.B vgaset
redisplays the mode settings in a form suitable for pasting into
.BR Xconfig .
Don't forget the
clock specification at the beginning of the line!

.SH Notes
The command to restore the initial values works correctly if you have
broken something, but it does not restore any register that you have
set explicitly.
.IR "Caveat utilitor" .
.PP
It is not possible to change the number or arrangement of
pixels displayed on the screen, because this would seriously
confuse the server.
