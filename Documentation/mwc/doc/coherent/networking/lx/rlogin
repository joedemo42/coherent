The command
.B rlogin
lets you log into
.I remotehost
without requiring that you re-type your login identifier and password.
You must have an account on
.I remotehost
under the same login identifier that you use on your local host,
and your password on both hosts must be the same.
.PP
.I remotehost
must name your local host in its copy of file
.BR /etc/hosts.equiv
before you can use
.B rlogin
to log into it.
.PP
When you log into
.IR remotesystem ,
.B rlogin
sets your environmental variable
.B TERM
on
.I remotesystem
to be the same as it is on your local host.
It also sets all relevant parameters for your terminal,
to help ensure that you can work on
.I remotehost
with a minimum of difficulty.
.PP
To disconnect from
.IR remotehost ,
log out as usual.
