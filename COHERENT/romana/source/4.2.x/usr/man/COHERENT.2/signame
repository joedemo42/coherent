When a program terminates abnormally, its parent process receives a byte of
termination information  from the system call wwaaiitt().  This byte contains a
signal number, as defined in  the header file ssiiggnnaall.hh. For example, SSIIGGIINNTT
indicates an interrupt from the terminal.

The array ssiiggnnaammee, indexed by signal number, contains strings that give the
meaning  of  each  signal.   Thus,  ssiiggnnaammee[SSIIGGIINNTT]  points to  the  string
``interrupt''.  For  portability reasons, all programs  which wait on child
processes (such as the shell sshh) should use ssiiggnnaammee.

Please note  that through  revision 10 of  the COHERENT manual,  the signal
numbers in ssiiggnnaammee[]  were offset  by one.  That  is erroneous:  the signal
numbers are not offset at all.

In standard  implementations of  UNIX, the  manifest constant NNSSIIGG  was one
larger than the number of signals.  Prior to release 4.2, however, COHERENT
defined  NNSSIIGG as  being equal  to  the number  of signals.   Beginning with
release  4.2, COHERENT  defines  NNSSIIGG to  conform  to the  UNIX usage,  and
introduces the manifest constant  _SSIIGGNNAALL_MMAAXX, which is equal to the number
of signals.   If your  code depends  upon the old  definition of  NNSSIIGG, you
should replace it with _SSIIGGNNAALL_MMAAXX.

Please note that ssiiggnnaammee[]  is obsolete,  and will  be removed  from future
releases of COHERENT.  Please do not  incorporate it into new code, and you
should try to remove it from existing code.
