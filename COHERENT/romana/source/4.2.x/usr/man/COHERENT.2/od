oodd -- Command

Print an octal dump of a file
oodd [-bbccddooxx] [_f_i_l_e] [ [+] _o_f_f_s_e_t[.][bb] ]

oodd prints  the specified _f_i_l_e  as a sequence  of octal numbers,  or machine
words.  If no _f_i_l_e is specified, oodd dumps the standard input.

The following options set the format of oodd's output:

    -bb  Bytes in default base
    -cc  Bytes in ASCII characters
    -dd  Words in decimal
    -oo  Words in octal
    -xx  Words in hexadecimal

The default base  is octal on the PDP-11 and  hexadecimal on the i80286, Z-
8001, and M68000 families of microprocessors.

Dumping can  start at position _o_f_f_s_e_t into the  file.  The specified _o_f_f_s_e_t
is octal unless the `.' suffix is present to signify decimal.  _o_f_f_s_e_t is in
bytes unless the bb suffix is present to signify 512-byte blocks.
