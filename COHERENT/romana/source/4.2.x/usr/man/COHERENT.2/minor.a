Device numbering

A _m_i_n_o_r  _n_u_m_b_e_r specifies the  device or type  of device to  use.  COHERENT
uses the minor  number of a given device in  a driver-specific manner.  For
example, a hard-disk driver may use the minor number to select a disk drive
and partition.

Every COHERENT  device has a  device number associated  with it.  It  is of
type ddeevv_tt, as defined  in <ssyyss/ttyyppeess.hh>. The macro mmiinnoorr() in <ssyyss/ssttaatt.hh>
extracts the minor number from a given device number.
