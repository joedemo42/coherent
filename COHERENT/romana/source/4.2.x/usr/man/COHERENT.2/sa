ssaa -- Command

Print a summary of process accounting
ssaa [-aabbccjjllmmnnrrssttuu] [-vv _N] [_f_i_l_e]

One  of  the accounting  mechanisms  available on  the  COHERENT system  is
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s  _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g  (also  called  _s_h_e_l_l  _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g), which  records  the
commands executed  by each  user.  The  command aaccccttoonn enables  or disables
shell accounting.

The  command ssaa  scans  the accounting  information  in _f_i_l_e  and prints  a
summary.  If  _f_i_l_e is omitted, it reads the  file /uussrr/aaddmm/aacccctt by default.
For each  command executed, ssaa prints  the number of calls  made, the total
CPU time (user and system), and the total real time.  The output is ordered
by decreasing CPU time.

ssaa recognizes the following options:

aa   Place commands  executed only once  and command names  with unprintable
    characters in the category ``***other''.

bb   Sort by average CPU time per call.

cc   Also print CPU time as a percentage of all CPU time used.

jj   Print average times per call rather than totals.

ll   Separate user and system time.

mm   Accumulate information for each user rather for each command.

nn   Sort by number of calls.

rr   Reverse the order of the sort.

ss   After  scanning, condense  the accounting  file and  merge it  into the
    summary files.

tt   Also print the CPU time as a percentage of real time.

uu   Print  the user  and command  for each  accounting record;  this option
    overrides all others.

vv _N For commands called  no more than _N times, where  _N is a digit, ssaa asks
    whether to place the command in the category ``**junk**''.

ssaa uses  the summary files /uussrr/aaddmm/ssaavvaacccctt  and /uussrr/aaddmm/uussrraacccctt to lessen
disk usage.

/uussrr/aaddmm/aacccctt -- Default account data

_N_o_t_e_s
The  file  /uussrr/aaddmm/aacccctt  can  become  very  large; therefore,  you  should
truncate  it  periodically.   Special  care  should  be  taken  if  process
accounting is enabled on a COHERENT system with limited disk space.
