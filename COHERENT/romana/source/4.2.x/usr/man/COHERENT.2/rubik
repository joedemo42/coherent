Play Rubik's cube
/uussrr/ggaammeess/rruubbiikk

The command  rruubbiikk lets  you fiddle with  an electronic version  of Rubik's
cube.  By issuing commands, you  can ``rotate'' the segments of the virtual
cube and, with some agony, align all the ``colors''.

rruubbiikk is  written in mm44, and  is a good example  of extended programming in
this utility.
