ttrruuee -- Command

Unconditional success
ttrruuee

ttrruuee does nothing, successfully.  It always returns zero (i.e., true).

ttrruuee  is useful  in shell  scripts  when you  want to  execute a  condition
indefinitely.  For example, the following example

    while true; do
        date
    done

prints the current date and time  on your screen forever (or at least until
interrupted by typing <ccttrrll-CC>).
