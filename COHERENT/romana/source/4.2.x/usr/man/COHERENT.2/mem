mmeemm -- Device Driver

Physical memory file

The special  file /ddeevv/mmeemm allows the physical memory  of the host computer
to be read and written just  like an ordinary file.  The location where I/O
will  occur can  be  positioned to  any  valid byte  address by  a call  to
llsseeeekk(). Note that ppss and related commands use /ddeevv/kkmmeemm, which manipulates
the kernel's data space.

Commands may examine or  change addresses in physical memory.  Addresses to
use when  changing the system itself normally are  obtained from the system
load  module  (/ccoohheerreenntt)  name  list,  so  that they  always  reflect  the
currently running version of the system.
