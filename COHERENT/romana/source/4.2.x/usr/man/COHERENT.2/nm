nnmm -- Command

Print a program's symbol table
nnmm [ -aaddggnnoopprruu ] _f_i_l_e ...

The command  nnmm prints the  symbol table of  each _f_i_l_e. It  can read binary
files produced by the compiler, assembler, or linker.

When a C  source file is compiled with the  -cc switch to the cccc command, or
when a  file of  assembly language  is assembled, the  result is  an object
module, which is signified by the suffix .oo.

The linker lldd links multiple  object modules to form an executable program.
Frequently used object modules often are  grouped by the archiver aarr into a
_l_i_b_r_a_r_y, which is signified by the  suffix .aa.  nnmm can read all three kinds
of files: .o, .a, and fully linked executables.

_O_p_t_i_o_n_s
nnmm recognizes the following options:

-aa (COHERENT 286 only)
   Print all symbols.  Normally, nnmm prints names that are in C-style format
   and ignores symbols with names inaccessible from C programs.

-dd Print only defined symbol.

-gg Print only global symbols.

-nn Sort numerically rather  than alphabetically.  nnmm uses unsigned compares
   when sorting symbols with this option.

-oo Append the file name to the beginning of each output line.

-pp Print symbols in the order in which they appear within the symbol table.

-rr Sort in reverse-alphabetical order.

-uu Print only undefined symbols.

_O_u_t_p_u_t _F_o_r_m_a_t
The output of nnmm is a series of lines of the form:

    _s_e_g_m_e_n_t _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _s_y_m_b_o_l

_s_e_g_m_e_n_t  gives  the segment  in  which  the symbol  appears,  or UUNNDDEEFF  for
undefined symbols.   _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is either  the address in  hexadecimal, or the
length of a common variable.  _s_y_m_b_o_l names the symbol.

For example,  if ffoooo.oo is  a relocatable object  module, the output  of the
command nnmm -oo ffoooo.oo would appears as follows:

    #nm foo.o
    UNDEF    00000000 _canl
    UNDEF    00000000 _stderr
    .text    0000077C acomp
    .text    00000034 acomp_old
    UNDEF    00000000 alloc
    .text    00000F28 archive
    .comm    00000004 asw
    .text    000003CC csymbol
    .comm    00000004 dsw
