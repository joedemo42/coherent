Device numbering

A _m_a_j_o_r  _n_u_m_b_e_r specifies the device driver associated  with a given device
name found in the directory /ddeevv. COHERENT uses a device's the major number
as an index into an internal table of device-driver pointers.

Every COHERENT device has a  device number associated with it.  This device
number is of type ddeevv_tt, as  defined in <ssyyss/ttyyppeess.hh>. The macro mmaajjoorr() in
<ssyyss/ssttaatt.hh> extracts the major number from a given device number.
