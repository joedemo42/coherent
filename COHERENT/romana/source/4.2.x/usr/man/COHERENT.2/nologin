Lock out logins
/eettcc/nnoollooggiinn

llooggiinn looks for file /eettcc/nnoollooggiinn before it permits a user to login in.  If
this file exists, llooggiinn forbids the user to log in, and instead displays on
the terminal  the contents of  this file -- which,  presumably, explain why
logging in is now forbidden.

You should  create this file when  you wish to ``lock  out'' users during a
critical time,  such as when  backups are being  run or when  the system is
about  to be  shut down.   When the  critical time has  passed, be  sure to
remove it.

llooggiinn cannot lock out the superuser rroooott, even if nnoollooggiinn exists.  Nor will
it lock out the users named in the file /eettcc/ttrruussttmmee, should it exist.

The script /eettcc/rrcc removes  /eettcc/nnoollooggiinn by default, on the assumption that
after you reboot, you once again  want users to be able to log in.  If this
is not a sound assumption, edit /eettcc/rrcc to change this behavior.
