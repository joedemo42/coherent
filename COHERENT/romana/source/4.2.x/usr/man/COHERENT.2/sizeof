ssiizzeeooff -- C Keyword

Return size of a data element

ssiizzeeooff is a  C operator that returns a constant  iinntt that gives the size of
any  given data  element.  The  element examined  can be  a data  object, a
portion of a  data object, or a type cast.   ssiizzeeooff returns the size of the
element in cchhaarrs; for example

    long foo;
    sizeof foo;

returns four, because a lloonngg is as long as four cchhaarrs.

ssiizzeeooff can also tell you the  size of an array.  This is especially helpful
for  use  with  external arrays,  whose  size  can  be  set when  they  are
initialized.  For example:

char *arrayname[] = {
    "COHERENT",
    "COHware volume I",
    "COHERENT Device Driver Kit",
        "GNU C/C++"
};

main()
{
    printf("\"arrayname\" has %d entries\n",
        sizeof(arrayname)/sizeof char*);
}

ssiizzeeooff  is especially  useful in  mmaalllloocc() routines, and  when you  need to
specify byte  counts to  I/O routines.   Using it to  set the size  of data
types instead of using  a predetermined value will increase the portability
of your code.
