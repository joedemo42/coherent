mmoooo is a guessing game of numbers, typically four digits, all different.

The  game  randomly selects  a  number that  consists  of _n_u_m_d_i_g_i_t_s  unique
digits.  Obviously, _n_u_m_d_i_g_i_t_s cannot  exceed ten; the default is four.  mmoooo
then prompts you  to guess the number it has  selected.  When you type your
guess, mmoooo  responds with one  of two possible  answers.  If you  guess the
number correctly,  i.e., win, mmoooo responds with ``Right!''.   If any of the
digits that  you guessed were correct  digits, but in the  wrong place, you
get a ``cow.'' If you guess a digit correctly and in the correct place, you
get a  ``bull.'' If the  number of ``bulls''  is the same as  the number of
digits  in the  guess, you  win.  mmoooo  typically responds  with a  count of
``bulls'' and ``cows,'' as in:

    2 bulls, 1 cow.
