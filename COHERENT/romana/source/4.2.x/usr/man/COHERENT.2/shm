sshhmm -- Kernel Module

Kernel module for shared memory

The kernel module sshhmm enables System V-style shared memory.  It is called a
_k_e_r_n_e_l _m_o_d_u_l_e  because you can link  it into your kernel  or exclude it, as
you wish,  just like a device  driver; yet it is not  a true device devicer
because it does not perform I/O with a peripheral device.
