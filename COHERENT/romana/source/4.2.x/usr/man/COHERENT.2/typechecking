ttyyppee cchheecckkiinngg -- Definition

Every  expression has  a  _t_y_p_e, such  as  iinntt, cchhaarr,  or ddoouubbllee.  C is  not
strongly  typed, which  means that  it allows different  types to  be mixed
relatively freely, and be changed (or ccaasstt) from one type to another.

COHERENT  checks   types  more  strictly  than   the  C  standard  implies.
COHERENT's type  checking can  be enabled or  disabled in degrees,  using -
VVSSTTRRIICCTT and other ``variant'' options with the cccc command.
