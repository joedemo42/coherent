TTMMPPDDIIRR -- Environmental Variable

Directory that holds temporary files

The command  cccc reads  the environmental variable  TTMMPPDDIIRR to see  where you
want  it  to write  its  temporary  files.  You  can  speed compilation  by
building a RAM disk and pointing TTMMPPDDIIRR to point at it.

For example, if  you have created a RAM disk  and mounted it as /zz, then by
embedding the instruction

    export TMPDIR=/z/tmp

in your  .pprrooffiillee, you can ensure  that cccc will write  all of its temporary
files onto the RAM disk.
