mmvv -- Command

Rename files or directories
mmvv [-ff] _o_l_d_f_i_l_e [_n_e_w_f_i_l_e]
mmvv [-ff] _f_i_l_e ... _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

mmvv renames files.  In the first  form above, it changes the name of _o_l_d_f_i_l_e
to _n_e_w_f_i_l_e. If  _n_e_w_f_i_l_e already exists, mmvv replaces it  with the file being
moved; if not, mmvv creates it.  If _n_e_w_f_i_l_e is a directory, mmvv places _o_l_d_f_i_l_e
under that directory.

In the second form, mmvv moves  each _f_i_l_e so that it resides under _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.
If a file with the new name exists but is unwritable, mmvv will not delete it
unless the -ff option is specified.

mmvv  will  not  copy   directories  between  devices  and  will  not  remove
directories that occupy the destination of the command.

Normally, mmvv  creates a  link to the  old file with  the new file  and then
removes the old file.  If it  cannot create the link (e.g., because the new
file is  on a different file  system than the old), mmvv  performs a copy and
then removes the old file.

_N_o_t_e_s
mmvv tests  the validity  of directory moves  by means of  search permission.
The superuser always has search permission and thus can use mmvv incorrectly.
