/eettcc/rrcc

The shell script /eettcc/rrcc is executed  by the iinniitt process when the COHERENT
system enters  multi-user mode.  The commands  in rrcc do such  things as set
the local time zone  and initialize file /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp, which holds records
of user logins.
