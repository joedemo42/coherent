ttaaiill -- Command

Print the end of a file
ttaaiill [+_n[bbccffll]] [_f_i_l_e]
ttaaiill [-_n[bbccffll]] [_f_i_l_e]

ttaaiill copies  the last  part of _f_i_l_e,  or of the  standard input if  none is
named, to the standard output.

The given  _n_u_m_b_e_r tells ttaaiill where  to begin to copy  the data.  Numbers of
the form +_n_u_m_b_e_r measure the starting point from the beginning of the file;
those of the form -_n_u_m_b_e_r measure from the end of the file.

A specifier of blocks, characters, or  lines (bb, cc, or ll, respectively) may
follow the  number; the  default is  lines.  If no  _n_u_m_b_e_r is  specified, a
default of -10 is assumed.

The -ff option  opens the tail of a file,  and then displays new material as
it is added  to a file.  This command lets you  watch a file as it is being
built, such as by nnrrooffff.  Note  that when ttaaiill is invoked with this option,
it does  not exit;  therefore, when  you wish to  exit, type  the interrupt
character (usually <ccttrrll-CC>).

_N_o_t_e_s
Because ttaaiill buffers  data measured from the end of  the file, large counts
may not work.
