ssttaacckk -- Definition

The ssttaacckk  is the  segment of memory  that holds function  arguments, local
variables, function return addresses, and stack frame linkage information.

If your  program uses  recursive algorithms,  or declares large  amounts of
automatic  data, or  simply contains  many levels  of functions  calls, the
stack may ``overflow'', and overwrite  the program data.  Note that this is
unlikely  with COHERENT,  because the 80386  has implemented  dynamic stack
allocation.
