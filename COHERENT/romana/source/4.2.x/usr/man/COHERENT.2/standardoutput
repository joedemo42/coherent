ssttaannddaarrdd oouuttppuutt -- Definition

The ssttaannddaarrdd  oouuttppuutt is the device  or file where programs  write output by
default.  It  is defined in the header file  ssttddiioo.hh under the abbreviation
ssttddoouutt, and in most instances is defined to be the computer's monitor.

The shell  lets you redirect into  a file all text  written to the standard
output device.  To do so, use the shell operator >. For example

    sort myfile >sortfile

redirects the text output by ssoorrtt into file ssoorrttffiillee.
