ssttrrppbbrrkk() -- String Function (libc)

Find first occurrence of a character from another string

cchhaarr *ssttrrppbbrrkk(_s_t_r_i_n_g_1, _s_t_r_i_n_g_2)
cchhaarr *_s_t_r_i_n_g_1, *_s_t_r_i_n_g_2;

ssttrrppbbrrkk() returns a pointer to  the first character in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 that matches
any  character in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.  It returns  NULL  if no  character in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_1
matches a character in _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.

The  set of  characters  that _s_t_r_i_n_g_2  points  to is  sometimes called  the
``break string''.  For example,

    char *string = "To be, or not to be: that is the question.";
    char *brkset = ",;";
    strpbrk(string, brkset);

returns the  value of  the pointer  ssttrriinngg plus five.   This points  to the
comma, which is  the first character in the area  pointed to by ssttrriinngg that
matches any character in the string pointed to by bbrrkksseett.

ssttrrppbbrrkk()  resembles the  function  ssttrrttookk() in  functionality, but  unlike
ssttrrttookk(), it preserves the contents of the strings being compared.  It also
resembles the function ssttrrcchhrr(), but lets you search for any one of a group
of characters, rather than for one character alone.
