ttyyppoo -- Command

Detect possible typographical and spelling errors
ttyyppoo [-nnrrss][_f_i_l_e ...]

ttyyppoo proofreads an  English-language document for typographical errors.  It
conducts a  statistical test of  letter digrams and trigrams  in each input
word against digram and trigram frequencies throughout the entire document.
From this test, ttyyppoo computes an  index of peculiarity for each word in the
document.   A high  index indicates  a word  less like  other words  in the
document  than  does   a  low  index.   Built-in  frequency  tables  ensure
reasonable results even for relatively short documents.

ttyyppoo reads  each input _f_i_l_e  (or the standard  input if none),  and removes
punctuation and non-alphabetic characters to produce a list of the words in
the document.  To reduce the volume  of the output, ttyyppoo compares each word
against a  small dictionary  of technical words  and discards it  if found.
The  output  consists  of  a  list  of  unique  non-dictionary  words  with
associated index of peculiarity, most peculiar first.  An index higher than
ten  indicates that  the  word almost  certainly  occurs only  once in  the
document.

ttyyppoo recognizes the following arguments:

-nn   Inhibit use of the built-in English digram and trigram statistics, and
     inhibit dictionary screening of  words.  More words will be output and
     the indices of peculiarity will be less useful for short documents.

-rr   Inhibit the  default stripping  of nnrrooffff escape  sequences.  Normally,
     ttyyppoo  strips lines  beginning with  `.' and  removes the  nnrrooffff escape
     sequences `\'.

-ss   Produce output files  ddiiggrraammss and ttrriiggrraammss that contain, respectively,
     the digram  and trigram frequency  statistics for the  given document.
     No  indices of  peculiarity are  calculated  or printed.   If desired,
     these files may be installed in directory /uussrr/ddiicctt.
