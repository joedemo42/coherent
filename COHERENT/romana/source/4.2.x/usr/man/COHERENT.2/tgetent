ttggeetteenntt() -- termcap Function (libterm)

Read termcap entry
iinntt ttggeetteenntt(_b_p, _n_a_m_e)
cchhaarr *_b_p, *_n_a_m_e;

ttggeetteenntt()  is one  of  a set  of  functions that  read  a tteerrmmccaapp  terminal
description.  It extracts the entry from file /eettcc/tteerrmmccaapp for the terminal
_n_a_m_e and  writes it into a  buffer at address _b_p. _b_p  should be a character
buffer of 1,024 bytes and must  be retained through all subsequent calls to
the other functions.  It returns -11 if it cannot open /eettcc/tteerrmmccaapp, zero if
the terminal name  given does not have an entry,  and one upon a successful
search.

ttggeetteenntt() first looks in the environment to see if the tteerrmmccaapp variable had
already been set.  If it finds that the variable tteerrmmccaapp has been set, that
the value does  _n_o_t begin with a slash, and  that the terminal type name in
the tteerrmmccaapp variable is the same  as that in the environment variable TTEERRMM,
then  ttggeetteenntt()  uses  the  tteerrmmccaapp  string  instead of  reading  the  file
/eettcc/tteerrmmccaapp. However, if the tteerrmmccaapp  string does begin with a slash, then
it is  used as  the path  name of a  terminal-capabilities file  other than
/eettcc/tteerrmmccaapp. This  can speed entry into programs  that call ttggeetteenntt(), and
can be used to help debug new terminal descriptions.
