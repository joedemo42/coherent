mmkklloosstt+ffoouunndd -- Command

Make an enlarged lost+found directory
/eettcc/mmkklloosstt+ffoouunndd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y [_s_l_o_t_s]

When the  command ffsscckk checks your file system,  it copies all ``orphaned''
files into  directory lloosstt+ffoouunndd in  the root directory of  the file system
being checked.   Normally, this works  well; however, if a  great number of
files are orphaned, directory lloosstt+ffoouunndd may  not be able to hold them all.
This is because  a directory is itself a file  that holds information about
the files  it contains; normally, COHERENT expands the  size of a directory
file when it needs more space  to hold files, but because ffsscckk is forbidden
to modify any file, it cannot enlarge lloosstt+ffoouunndd. Thus, orphaned files that
cannot be copied into lloosstt+ffoouunndd are deleted.

Script mmkklloosstt+ffoouunndd lets  you build an enlarged lloosstt+ffoouunndd directory within
_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y. It initializes the lloosstt+ffoouunndd directory to be able to hold _s_l_o_t_s
files.  If you do not specify how many files you want lloosstt+ffoouunndd to be able
to hold, mmkklloosstt+ffoouunndd initializes it to hold 250 files.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following  command creates a  lloosstt+ffoouunndd directory that  can hold 1,000
files for the file system that is mounted on directory /nneewwss:

    /etc/mklost+found /news 1000
