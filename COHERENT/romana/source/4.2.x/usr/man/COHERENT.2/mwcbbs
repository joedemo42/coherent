mmwwccbbbbss -- Command

Download files from the Mark Williams bulletin board
mmwwccbbbbss [-ccpp] [-dd_p_a_t_h] _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

The  command mmwwccbbbbss  lets you  select one  or more  files from  mmwwccbbbbss, the
bulletin  board  maintained  by Mark  Williams  Company.   It displays  the
contents of CCoonntteennttss files that  you download from the bulletin board, lets
you select one or more  files interactively, then constructs a uuuuccpp command
and requests  the files from  Mark Williams.  If  all goes well,  the files
will  be  delivered  to  directory  /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccppppuubblliicc on  your  system.
mmwwccbbbbss.  In  this way,  you  can  obtain the  latest  versions of  COHERENT
software,  sources  for  public-domain software  that  has  been ported  to
COHERENT, and exchange mail with MWC developers and support personnel.

_O_p_t_i_o_n_s
mmwwccbbbbss recognizes the following options:

-cc   Force uuuuccpp to telephone the Mark Williams bulletin board when you exit
     from mmwwccbbbbss.

-dd_p_a_t_h
     Use _p_a_t_h in place of the default receive path.

-pp   Print  the CCoonntteennttss  file.  You  can print all  entries in  a CCoonntteennttss
     file, or entries newer than a specified date.

mmwwccbbbbss  looks for  the file  .mmwwccbbbbss in the  current directory.   This file
contains the  interface variables DDOOWWNNPPAATTHH  and DDAATTAAPPAATTHH. The  former names
names the  directory into which uuuuccpp  is to write the  requested files; and
the latter names the directory where you keep data files.  For example:

    DOWNPATH=/usr/spool/uucppublic/
    DATAPATH=/usr/lib/mwcbbs

Please note that path names are limited to 45 characters.

When you invoke mmwwccbbbbss, it displays a menu with the following items:

00. CCoonntteennttss.ddoowwnn
     List  public-domain  software  and  shareware available  for  COHERENT
     release 3._N (COHERENT 286).

11. CCoonntteennttss.3322bbiitt
     List  public-domain  software  and  shareware available  for  COHERENT
     release 4._N (COHERENT 386).

22. CCoonntteennttss.nneewwss
     List news items and other informative postings from MWC.

33. CCoonntteennttss.UUPPDD
     List updates to COHERENT.

44. MMaaiilllliisstt
     List the mail sites available through mmwwccbbbbss.

55. NNeett_MMaappss
     Show available network maps of world-wide UNIX sites.

66. QQuuiitt
     Exit from mmwwccbbbbss.

_D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_i_n_g _F_i_l_e_s
If you  select items 0  through 3 from  the main menu,  mmwwccbbbbss displays the
names of files,  100 at a time.  These names  are read from a CCoonntteennttss file
that is  stored in a  directory you name  either with the option  -dd or the
variable DDAATTAAPPAATTHH.

You can select  one or more of these files  for downloading to your system.
Note  that when  you  invoke mmwwccbbbbss  for  the first  time,  the only  files
displayed are  those of  the CCoonntteennttss  files themselves; you  must download
them first, before you can begin  to download other files.  This is because
the CCoonntteennttss are continually being updated, and also to test your UUCP with
the Mark  Williams bulletin  board before you  attempt to download  a large
number of source files.

To select a file for downloading,  use the arrow keys to move the cursor to
that file (or use the vvii  cursor-movement keys hh, jj, kk, and ll). mmwwccbbbbss lets
you enter any of the following commands:

-ss   Select  highlighted file  name  for more  information or  downloading.
     Pressing <rreettuurrnn> also selects the file.

-nn   Go to next screen (if there are more than 100 files).

-pp   Go to the previous screen.

-qq   Quit mmwwccbbbbss.

When  you  select   a  highlighted  file,  mmwwccbbbbss  displays  the  following
information about it:

-> A summary of the file.

-> The date it was added or last updated

-> Other files  that are required  for compilation or use  of selected file
   name.

-> Other miscellaneous notes that may be of interest.

-> The system  commands to be generated to download  the selected file from
   the Mark Williams bulletin board.

If a  file is more  than 50,000 bytes  long, mmwwccbbbbss downloads  it in parts.
When a file is to be  received in parts you must concatenate the parts into
one file, which should be given the name of the file you selected.

_L_i_s_t_s _a_n_d _N_e_t_w_o_r_k_s
Item 4  on the main menu (MMaaiilllliisstt) gives  you information about electronic
mail  sites throughout  the United  States.  When  you select  this option,
mmwwccbbbbss displays  the names of the  50 states.  When you  select a state, as
with the  file lists, mmwwccbbbbss  displays information about the  mail sites in
that state.

Item 5  (NNeett_MMaappss) gives you  information about networks.   When you select
this option, mmwwccbbbbss displays a menu with the following items:

00. NNeett_MMaappss.WWOORRLLDD
     Network maps of UNIX sites across the world.

11. NNeett_MMaappss.UUSSAA
     Network maps of UNIX sites in the United States, by area code.

22. NNeett_MMaappss.CCAANN
     Network maps of UNIX sites in Canada, by area code.

33. QQuuiitt
     Return to main menu.

Options 0 through  2 display maps of available networks.   You can select a
map interactively, as with the file options.

_P_r_i_n_t_i_n_g _a _C_o_n_t_e_n_t_s _F_i_l_e
When  you invoke  mmwwccbbbbss with  its -pp  option, it  lists the  four CCoonntteennttss
files.  When  you select one, mmwwccbbbbss  asks you to enter  a search date.  If
you enter  a search date, mmwwccbbbbss  prints only those entries  that are dated
later than that date.  If you do not enter a date, it prints every entry in
the CCoonntteennttss file entries.

Entries are printed to the file mmwwccbbbbss. When the entries have been printed,
mmwwccbbbbss automatically exits to the shell.

mmwwccbbbbss does not work correctly  until you have correctly configured UUCP to
contact the Mark Williams bulletin board.  For details on how to do so, see

The  charges for  downloading  a large  set  of files  via a  long-distance
telephone call  can be quite  heavy.  Much depends  upon the speed  of your
modem and the time you place your call.  _C_a_v_e_a_t _u_t_i_l_i_t_o_r!
