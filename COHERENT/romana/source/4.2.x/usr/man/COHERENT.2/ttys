Describe terminal ports

File /eettcc/ttttyyss describes the terminals in the COHERENT system.  The process
iinniitt reads this file when it brings up the system in multi-user mode.

/eettcc/ttttyyss contains  one line for each terminal.  Each  line consists of the
following four fields:

11.   The first field is one character  long, and indicates if the device is
     enabled for logins: `0' indicates  that the device is not enabled, and
     `1' (one) indicates that logins are enabled for the device.

22.   The  second field  is one  character long,  and indicates  whether the
     device  is local  (i.e., a  terminal) or remote  (i.e., a  modem): `r'
     indicates remote, and `l' (lower-case LL) indicates local.

     If  the port  is named  in file /eettcc/ddiiaalluuppss,  then the  command llooggiinn
     checks  the file  /eettcc/dd_ppaasssswwdd  to see  if  the program  the user  is
     invoking is protected  by a password.  If so, it  prompts the user for
     that additional password before  allowing her to log in.  For details,
     see the Lexicon entries for llooggiinn, ddiiaalluuppss, and dd_ppaasssswwdd.

33.   The third field is one character  long, and sets the baud rate for the
     device.  Note  that a device can  have either a fixed  baud rate, or a
     variable baud  rate.  The  following table  gives the codes  for fixed
     baud rates:

     1.0iR
     CC   110
     GG   300
     II   1200
     LL   2400
     NN   4800
     PP   9600
     QQ   19200
     SS   38400

     The common variable-speed codes terminal types are as follows:

     00   300, 1200, 150, 110
     33   2400, 1200, 300

     When a user dials into a variable-speed line, a message is sent to the
     terminal   using  the   first  speed  listed.    If  the   message  is
     unintelligible, the user hits the <bbrreeaakk> key and the system tries the
     next speed; and so on, until the correct speed is selected.

44.   The fourth field names the port that this device is plugged into.  The
     following table names the ports that COHERENT recognizes:

     ccoonnssoollee             The console device
     ccoolloorr_N              Virtual console device _N, color console
     mmoonnoo_N               Virtual console device _N, monochrome console
     ccoomm_Nll               Serial port ccoomm_N, local device
     ccoomm_Nrr               Serial port ccoomm_N, remote device
     ccoomm_Nppll              Serial port ccoomm_N, local polled device
     ccoomm_Npprr              Serial port ccoomm_N, remote polled device

     Note  that if  field 2  (described above)  says that  this is  a local
     device,  then  you  must use  a  port  descriptor  that  ends in  `l';
     likewise, if  field 2 states  that this is  a remote device,  the port
     descriptor must  end in `r'.  Doing otherwise  will result in trouble.
     See Lexicon entry aassyy for details.

Do not leave  trailing spaces at the end of  an entry in /eettcc/ttttyyss. Leaving
blanks at  the end of  a line usually  results in errors that  state that a
device could not be found.

After you  have edited /eettcc/ttttyyss, the following  command forces COHERENT to
re-read the file and use the new descriptions:

    kill quit 1

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
Consider the following ttttyyss entry:

    1lPconsole

Field  1 is  the  first character.   Here  it is  set to  `1' (one),  which
indicates that  the device is  enabled for logins.   Field 2 is  the second
character.  Here it is set to `l' (lower-case LL), which indicates that this
is a  local device.  Field  3 is the  third character.  Here, it  is set to
`P', which  indicates that the  device operates at  the fixed baud  rate of
9600 baud.   This field is ignored  by the console device  driver since the
console is not  a serial device.  Finally, field 4  is the remainder of the
line.  Here, it indicates that the device in question is the console.

Now, consider another example:

    1r3com3r

Field  1 is  the  first character.   Here  it is  set to  `1' (one),  which
indicates that  the device is  enabled for logins.   Field 2 is  the second
character.  Here  it is set to  `r', which indicates that  this is a remote
device, i.e., a modem.  Field 3 is the third character.  Here, it is set to
`3', which  indicates that  the device operates  at variable baud  rates of
2400, 1200, and 300.  By hitting  the <bbrreeaakk> key on the terminal, the user
can  select from  among those  three baud rates,  in that  order.  Finally,
field 4 is  the remainder of the line.  Here,  it indicates that the device
in question  is plugged into  port ccoomm33, and  is accessed via  special file
/ddeevv/ccoomm33rr.

_N_o_t_e_s
If  you wish  to enable  logins on  a COM  port on which  you will  also be
dialing  out, you  must edit  file  /eettcc/ttttyyss and  add a  line for  the raw
device.  For example, if you have a modem plugged into COM1 and you wish to
dial out  on that port,  you must have  an entry for both  ccoomm11ll and ccoomm11rr.
Note that the  entry for ccoomm11rr _m_u_s_t precede the  entry for ccoomm11ll. If you do
not do  this, the commands ccuu  and uuuucciiccoo cannot disable  ccoomm11rr before they
dial out on ccoomm11ll.

ccuu  also  requires  that  the  device  /ddeevv/ccoonnssoollee  appear  last  in  file
/eettcc/ttttyyss. If  this is not  so, ccuu refuses  to disable the  enabled port or
dial out.
