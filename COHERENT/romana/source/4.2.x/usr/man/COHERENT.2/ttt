The COHERENT  game tttttt  plays three-dimensional tic-tac-toe.   Each playing
board is four-by-four, and four are stacked on top of each other.  You play
against the  computer; each player selects to occupy  one ``square'' on one
of the boards.  The first player  to get four four squares in a row, in any
direction, wins.
