ssrrccppaatthh -- Command

Find source files
ssrrccppaatthh [-aaww] [-pp _p_a_t_h] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ...

The command ssrrccppaatthh  expands the environmental variable SSRRCCPPAATTHH, applies it
to each argument, and prints the full path of each unique result.

An  argument can  either be  a file  name or a  pattern.  For  example, the
command

    srcpath "*.[ch]"

finds all .cc  and .hh files on SSRRCCPPAATTHH. By  default.  ssrrccppaatthh keeps only the
first file that it finds  with a given name.  ssrrccppaatthh automatically appends
`.' to  the beginning  of SSRRCCPPAATTHH  so files in  the current  directory have
precedence.

ssrrccppaatthh recognizes the following command-line options:

-pp _p_a_t_h
   Use _p_a_t_h as its path instead of SSRRCCPPAATTHH. For example,

       srcpath -p ".:/usr/src/cmd" "*.c"

   tells ssrrccppaatthh  to search `.' and /uussrr/ssrrcc/ccmmdd  instead of  SSRRCCPPAATTHH. Note
   that with  this option, ssrrccppaatthh does not automatically  place `.' at the
   beginning of the list.

-aa Disable shadowing.   Normally, if ssrrccppaatthh finds a file  is found in more
   than one directory on the path, it prints only the first.  The -aa option
   forces ssrrccppaatthh to print all instances of the file name.

-ww By default, ssrrccppaatthh silently bypasses directories and matching files for
   which it  has no read  permission.  The -ww  option causes it  to print a
   warning message when this happens.
