mmeessgg -- Command

Permit/deny messages from other users
mmeessgg [nnyy]

Normally, a user can communicate with other users by using the commands mmssgg
and wwrriittee.

In certain situations, it is  useful to suppress messages from other users.
Therefore, COHERENT  supplies the command  mmeessgg, which, lets  you permit or
suppress  messages  from  other users.   The  argument  yy allows  messages,
whereas argument  nn disallows messages.   With no argument,  mmeessgg tells you
whether  you can  receive  messages (as  yyeess  or nnoo)  without changing  the
message state.
