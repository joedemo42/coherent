rroouuttee -- Command

Show or reset a user's default printer
rroouuttee [_p_r_i_n_t_e_r]

The  command rroouuttee  shows  or resets  your default  printer.  When  invoked
without  an argument,  it displays  your  default printer,  plus a  list of
available alternative printers.  When invoked with the argument _p_r_i_n_t_e_r, it
changes your default printer to  that printer.  _p_r_i_n_t_e_r must name a printer
that has been described to the spooler by the command llppaaddmmiinn.

Note  that this  feature  is an  extension  to the  version of  llpp that  is
included with UNIX System V.

rroouuttee is unique to the MLP  implementation of the llpp spooler.  Scripts that
use it will not be portable to other implementations of llpp.
