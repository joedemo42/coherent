ppoorrtt -- System Administration

File that links serial ports with dialers
/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ppoorrtt

File /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ppoorrtt  names and describes  the serial ports  that uuuucciiccoo
and ccuu use to connect to remote systems.

ppoorrtt consists  of a set of  entries, one for each  port.  Entries should be
separated from each other by one blank line.  Each entry consists of one or
more of the following commands:

ppoorrtt _p_o_r_t__n_a_m_e
     Name  the port  being described.   This command  must appear  first in
     every port's entry.

ttyyppee _s_t_r_i_n_g
     This command gives the type of port.  It must appear immediately after
     the ppoorrtt  command.  _s_t_r_i_n_g can be either  ddiirreecctt, which indicates that
     the port  directly accesses another system;  or mmooddeemm, which indicates
     that the port accesses a modem.  The default is mmooddeemm.

pprroottooccooll _s_t_r_i_n_g
     List   the  protocol   that   can  be   used  with   this  port.    If
     /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss  contains  a  list  of  protocols, that  list  takes
     precedence over  the one set  in ppoorrtt. We recommend  that protocols be
     specified  in ssyyss  file  entries.  For  information  on the  available
     protocols, see the Lexicon article ssyyss.

ddeevviiccee _s_t_r_i_n_g
     This command names the  device associated with the port.  For example,
     the command

         device /dev/com2l

     names port ccoomm22ll as the device used by this port.

bbaauudd _n_u_m_b_e_r
     Set   the  baud   rate  for   this   port.   If   an  entry   in  file
     /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss specifies  a speed but  no port entry,  uuuucciiccoo tries
     every entry  in ppoorrtt that  has a matching  baud rate, in  the order in
     which they appear, until it finds one that is unlocked.

bbaauudd-rraannggee _l_o_w _h_i_g_h
     This command  gives a range of  speeds at which this  port can be run.
     _l_o_w gives  the minimum speed, _h_i_g_h the  maximum.  This command applies
     only to ports that have modems attached to them.

ddiiaalleerr _s_t_r_i_n_g
     Names the modem, or  _d_i_a_l_e_r, attached to this port.  Information about
     the dialer is read  from file /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ddiiaall. This applies only to
     ports that have modems attached to them.

sseevveenn-bbiitt ttrruuee/ffaallssee
     If ttrruuee, then this port (or  the modem plugged into it ) supports only
     seven-bit  transfers; if  false, then it  supports both  seven-bit and
     eight-bit protocols.   uuuucciiccoo uses  this command only  during protocol
     negotiation, to force the selection  of a protocol that works across a
     seven-bit link.   It will not prevent  eight-bit characters from being
     transmitted.  The default is ffaallssee.

     Note that some devices use only  seven bits to define a character, and
     reserve the eighth bit as a  parity bit.  It is not possible it is not
     possible to send eight-bit characters across such devices.

hhaallff-dduupplleexx ttrruuee/ffaallssee
     If  ttrruuee, then  this  port supports  only half-duplex  communications,
     which  forces uuuucciiccoo  not to  use a  bidirectional protocol  with this
     port.  If  it is  ffaallssee, then the  port supports both  half-duplex and
     full-duplex communications.  The default is ffaallssee.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following gives a sample entry for a port:

    port MWCBBS
    type modem
    device /dev/com2l
    baud 9600
    dialer tbfast
The following describes each command in detail:

ppoorrtt This  names the  port  being described  in  this entry,  in this  case
     MMWWCCBBBBSS.

ttyyppee The type of port -- in this case, a modem.

ddeevviiccee
     The device  used by  this port.  The  device name usually  matches the
     port name, but it does not have to.

bbaauudd The speed of the port, in this case 9600.

ddiiaalleerr
     The type of dialing device (i.e.,  modem) plugged into this port -- in
     this case,  the dialer named  ttbbffaasstt. This dialer is  described in the
     file /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ddiiaall. For  information on how a dialer is described
     in its file, see the Lexicon entry for ddiiaall.

The  file ppoorrtt  supports many  commands in addition  to the  ones described
here.  This  article describes  only those commands  that might be  used in
typical UUCP  connections.  For more  information, see the  original Taylor
UUCP documentation, which is in the archive /uussrr/ssrrcc/aalliieenn/uuuuddoocc110044.ttaarr.ZZ.
