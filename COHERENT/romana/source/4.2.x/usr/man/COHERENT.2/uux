uuuuxx -- Command

Execute a command on a remote system
uuuuxx [-aa _u_s_e_r] [-rrnnppzz] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g

The  command  uuuuxx executes  commands  on  a remote  system.   uuuuxx works  in
conjunction with  the UUCP  system.  It  is not generally  used by  the end
user, but is instead called by  the various UUCP components to request that
work  be performed  at  a remote  system.   For security  reasons, you  can
execute  on  the  remote  system  only  the commands  that  are  explicitly
permitted by the  remote system, as described in the  entry for your system
in the remote system's copy of /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss.

If all permissions are in order,  an appropriately named XX. file is created
in   the  remote   system's  directory   /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/_y_o_u_r_s_y_s_t_e_m,  where
_y_o_u_r_s_y_s_t_e_m gives  the name  by which the  remote system knows  your system.
This file is then executed by the remote system's copy of uuuuxxqqtt.

_c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g  consists  of  a  command  name  followed by  zero  or  more
arguments.  Both the  command name and the arguments may  be prefixed by an
optional system  name (sitename)  and an  exclamation mark.  Note  that all
special characters must be escaped  or enclosed in quotation marks to avoid
being processed by your system's shell.

For example, the simplest form of the uuuuxx command is:

    uux host!command arg0 arg1 argN

where _h_o_s_t is  the name of the remote system  being contacted, as described
in  the file  /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss,  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is  the  name of  the command  to
execute on the  remote system, and _a_r_g_0 through _a_r_g_N  give the arguments to
_c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

If an argument names a file,  that file can either be on the remote system,
on your system, or on some third system.  For example, the command

    uux widget!lpr /usr/sally/herfile

requests site wwiiddggeett to print its own file /uussrr/ssaallllyy/hheerrffiillee. On the other
hand, the command

    uux widget!lpr !$HOME/myfile

requests that  site wwiiddggeett print on  its line printer the  file mmyyffiillee from
your home directory  on your home system.  Note that  the `!' that prefixes
mmyyffiillee indicates that it is on your system.  Finally, the command

    uux widget!lpr lepanto!/usr/fred/hisfile

requests  that wwiiddggeett  print file /uussrr/ffrreedd/hhiissffiillee  which resides  on site
lleeppaannttoo. Note that if wwiiddggeett does not know how to contact site lleeppaannttoo, the
command fails.

If you wish, you can embed the shell operators `<', `>', `;', or `|' within
a uuuuxx  command.  This lets you  construct a more powerful  command than you
could do otherwise.  Commands that contain these operators must, of course,
be quoted so ensure that your  shell does not interpret them.  For example,
the command

    uux "widget!pr /usr/sally/herfile > lepanto!~/fred/hisfile"

tells uuuuxx  to use pprr to  format its file /uussrr/ssaallllyy/hheerrffiillee,  and write the
output into file  /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccppppuubblliicc/ffrreedd/hhiissffiillee on site lleeppaannttoo. (Note
that the  tilde `~',  as always,  is a synonym  for /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccppppuubblliicc.)
Again,  the command  fails if  you do not  have appropriate  permissions on
wwiiddggeett or if wwiiddggeett does not have appropriate permissions on lleeppaannttoo.

The operator  `-' lets you use  the standard input when  constructing a uuuuxx
command.  For example, the command

    who | uux - widget!lp

executes the wwhhoo command on your system, pipes the output to uuuuxx, and tells
uuuuxx to invoke  the command llpp on remote system  wwiiddggeett to print the list of
users on your system.

uuuuxx will attempt to transfer any needed input files to the system that will
be executing  the requested command.   You must enclose  in parentheses any
output  files generated  by _c_o_m_m_a_n_d,  to distinguish  them from  input file
names.

uuuuxx recognizes the following options:

-aa _u_s_e_r
     Use _u_s_e_r as the name of the requester.  The default is the requester's
     login name.

-gg _g_r_a_d_e
     I grade  is a single ASCII character that  indicates the importance of
     the files  being transmitted: the  lower the value of  _g_r_a_d_e, the more
     important the files.

-rr   Queue  the  uuuuxx  request but  do  not  invoke  uuuucciiccoo  to perform  the
     transfer.  The default is to initiate uuuucciiccoo.

-nn   Suppress notification  of command completion.  The  default is to send
     mail to the requester after the command has been run.

-pp   Input to uuuuxx will be via a pipe or input redirection.

-zz   Notify requester when  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g succeeds.  The default is to not
     generate a notification.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
The  following script  uses a  remote system to  print files.   Print files
specified on  the command line  are sent unprocessed to  system pprrnnssrrvvrr for
printing using  command llpp. Note that  since the -rr option  is specified to
uuuuxx, uuuucciiccoo  will not be  invoked automatically, thus  causing the requests
simply to be queued.

    for i in $*
    do
        uux -r prnsrvr!lp !$i
    done

The next  example copies file  /ffoooo from system  ggeeoorrggee and file  /bbaarr from
system nnoorrmmss  to your system  and then invokes  command ccmmpp to  compare the
contents of the files.  The results  of the comparison are placed in output
file  /ttmmpp/ccmmpp.rreessuullttss on  the local  system,  and notification  of command
completion is sent via electronic mail.

    uux -z "!cmp -l george!/foo norms!/bar >/tmp/cmp.results"

This example assumes that your system can talk to both ggeeoorrggee and nnoorrmmss and
that your system has permission to  read file /ffoooo on system ggeeoorrggee as well
as to read file /bbaarr on system nnoorrmmss.

The last example runs a remote C compile on system ccsseerrvveerr using local file
mmyyccooddee.cc as  input and producing  executable file mmyyccooddee as  output.  Any C
compiler error  messages will  be placed in  file /ttmmpp/eerrrroorrss on  the local
system.
