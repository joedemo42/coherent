ttaarr -- Command

Archiving/backup utility
ttaarr [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _f_i_l_e ...

ttaarr  is a  utility that  lets  you read,  write, and  update archives  in a
machine-independent format.  Its  name is an abbreviation for _t_a_p_e _a_r_c_h_i_v_e;
however, ttaarr can read/write output to files and floppy disks, as well as to
magnetic tape.

ttaarr is now a link to the command ggttaarr, which implements tape archiving more
robustly  than did  the version  of  ttaarr shipped  with earlier  editions of
COHERENT.  For details on how to use ggttaarr, turn to its in the Lexicon.
