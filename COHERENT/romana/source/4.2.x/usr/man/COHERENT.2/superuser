ssuuppeerruusseerr -- Definition

The _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r is the user  who has system-wide permissions.  He can execute
any program, read any file,  and write into any directory.  Thus, superuser
status is reserved to the system administrator, also called rroooott, who needs
this status to control the operation of the system.

No  person  should  be able  to  become  the  superuser  without knowing  a
password.   Because  the  superuser  in  effect  ``owns'' the  system,  the
superuser password should be guarded most carefully.
