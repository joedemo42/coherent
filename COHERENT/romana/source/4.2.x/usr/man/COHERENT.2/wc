wwcc -- Command

Count words, lines, and characters in text files
wwcc [-ccllww] [_f_i_l_e...]

wwcc counts words,  lines, and characters in each _f_i_l_e.  If no _f_i_l_e is given,
wwcc uses the standard input.  If more than one _f_i_l_e is given, wwcc also prints
a total for all of the files.

wwcc defines  a _w_o_r_d to be  a string of characters  surrounded by white space
(blanks, tabs,  or newlines).   It defines  the number of  lines to  be the
number of newline characters in the file, plus one.

wwcc recognizes the following options:

-cc Count only characters.

-ll Count only lines.

-ww Count only words.

The default action is to print all counts.
