ssccaatt -- Command

Print text files one screenful at a time
ssccaatt [ [_o_p_t_i_o_n ...] [_f_i_l_e ... ] ] ...

ssccaatt prints each _f_i_l_e on the standard output, one screenful (24 lines) at a
time if the  output is a screen.  ssccaatt reads  and prints the standard input
if no _f_i_l_e is named.

The text is processed to allow  convenient viewing on a screen; the options
described below select the nature of the processing.  Options begin with `-
' and may be interspersed with file names.

ssccaatt scans two argument lists.  The  first is in the environmental SSCCAATT. It
should  consist  of arguments  separated  by white  space  (space, tab,  or
newline characters), with  no quoting or shell metacharacters.  This string
is a useful place to  set terminal-dependent parameters (such as page width
and length) and to place invocation lists (see below).  The second argument
list is supplied on the command line.

ssccaatt recognizes the following options:

-11   Do not  stop at EOF if  exactly one file was  specified on the command
     line.

-bb_n  Begin output at input line _n.

-cc   Represent  all control  characters unambiguously.   With  this option,
     ssccaatt prints  control characters in  the range 0-037 as  a character in
     the range 0100-0137 prefixed by  a carat `^'; for example, SOH appears
     as ``^A''  and DEL as ``^?'' It prints  mark-parity characters (in the
     range of  0200-0377) with  `~'; for  example, mark-parity `A'  and SOH
     appear  as ``~A''  and ``~^A'',  respectively.   It also  prefixes the
     characters `^',  `~', and `\'  with a `\'.  This  option overrides the
     option -tt.

-ccss  Like -cc, but map space ` ' to underscore `_' and prefix underscore `_'
     with `\'.

-cctt  Like -cc, but map tabs to spaces, not ``^I''.

-ii_n  Shift the display window right _n columns into the text field.  This is
     useful for viewing long lines.

-ll_n  Set the display window length to _n lines.  The default is 24 normally,
     34 for the Tek 4012.

-nn   Number input lines; wrapped lines are not numbered.

-rr   Remote; the output is not paged.

-ss   Skip empty lines.

-SS_n  Seek _n bytes into input before processing.

-tt   Truncate long  lines.  Normally, ssccaatt  wraps each long  line, with the
     interrupted portion delimited by a `\'.

-ww_n  Set  the  display  window width  to  _n  columns.   The  default is  80
     normally, 72 for the Tek 4012.

-xx   Expand tabs.

-. _s_u_f_f_i_x
     Invoke options by file-name suffix.  If a file name ends with ._s_u_f_f_i_x,
     then ssccaatt  scans the argument  sublist starting immediately  after the
     invocation flag.  New options will apply to the invoking file only.  A
     sublist is terminated by the end of the argument list, by a file name,
     by  the ``--''  flag, or  by another ``-.''  (invocation lists  do not
     nest).

--   Terminate a sublist (see previous option).

Numbers may  begin with 00 to  indicate octal, and may  end in bb or  kk to be
scaled by 512 or 1,024, respectively.

If the output is being paged,  ssccaatt waits for a user response, which may be
one of the following:

nneewwlliinnee Display next page
/       Display next half-page
ssppaaccee   Display next line
ff       Print current file name and line number
nn       ssccaatt next file
qq       Quit

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following  shows how to  use the environment  argument list, invocation
lists, and sublists:

SCAT="-l24 -.c -n -.s -b5"
export SCAT
scat *.c *.s

After processing  the SSCCAATT argument  list, ssccaatt processes  the command line
argument list ``*.cc *.ss'' with the page length at 24 lines.  If a file is a
C source (``*.cc'') the invoke option  in the SSCCAATT argument list numbers the
output lines.   If a file  is an assembly  source (``*.ss'') ssccaatt  skips the
first four lines.
