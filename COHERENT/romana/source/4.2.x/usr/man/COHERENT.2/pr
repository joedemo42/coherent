pprr -- Command

Paginate and print files
pprr [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e ...]

pprr paginates each named _f_i_l_e and sends it to the standard output.  The file
name `-' means standard input.  If  no _f_i_l_e is named, pprr reads the standard
input.

Each page  has a header that  gives the date, file name,  and page and line
numbers.  pprr may be used with the following options.

+ _s_k_i_p
     Skip the first _s_k_i_p pages of each input file.

-_N   Print the text in _N columns.   This is used to print out material that
     was typed in one or more columns.

-hh _h_e_a_d_e_r
     Use _h_e_a_d_e_r in place of the  text name in the title.  If _h_e_a_d_e_r is more
     than one word long, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

-ll_N  Set the page length to _N lines (default, 66).

-mm   Print the  texts simultaneously, in separate  columns.  Each text will
     be assigned an equal amount of width on the page, and any lines longer
     than  that width  will be  truncated.  This is  used to  print several
     similar texts or listings simultaneously.

-nn   Number each line as it is printed.

-ss_c  Separate each column by the character _c. You can separate columns with
     a letter  of the alphabet,  a period, or an  asterisk.  Normally, each
     column is left justified in a fixed-width field.

-tt   Suppress the printing  of the header on each page,  and the header and
     footer space.

-ww_N  Set  the  page width  to  _N  columns (default,  80).   Text lines  are
     truncated to fit the column width.  The maximum width is 254 columns.
