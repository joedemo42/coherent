nnyybbbbllee -- Definition

A nnyybbbbllee is four bits, or half of an eight-bit byte.  The term is generally
used to refer to the low  four bits or the high four bits of a byte.  Thus,
a byte  may be said  to have a  ``low nybble'' and a  ``high nybble''.  One
nybble encodes one hexadecimal digit.
