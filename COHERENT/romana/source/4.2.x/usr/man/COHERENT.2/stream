ssttrreeaamm -- Definition

The term  ssttrreeaamm is a  metaphor for any  entity that can be  named and from
which  bits can  flow, such  as a  device or a  file.  The  name ``stream''
reflects the  fact that the C programming environment  does not depend upon
record descriptors  and other devices that predetermine  what form data can
assume; instead,   data from whatever source are conceived  as being a flow
of bytes whose significance is set entirely by the program that reads them.

For example, whether 16 bits forms an iinntt, two cchhaarrs, and should be used as
an absolute value or a bit map, is entirely up to the program that receives
it.  It  is also  irrelevant to  the program that  processes these  16 bits
whether  they come  from  the keyboard,  from  a file  on disk,  or from  a
peripheral device.

The  FFIILLEE structure  holds all  of the information  needed to  manipulate a
stream.   The STDIO  functions can  be  used to  open, close,  or reopen  a
stream; read data from it; or write data to it.
