PPSSffoonntt -- Command

Cook an Adobe font into PostScript format
PPSSffoonntt [-qqss] [ _i_n_f_i_l_e.ppffbb [ _o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] ]

The command  PPSSffoonntt ``cooks'' a  file that is  in Adobe's downloadable-font
format into  PostScript.  The  output of PPSSffoonntt  can either be  loaded into
your PostScript printer as a memory-resident font, which can be used across
multiple files, or included within the output of ttrrooffff.

PPSSffoonntt recognizes two options:

-qq   Quiet  option:  suppress the  printing  of  warning messages.   PPSSffoonntt
     normally complains about  error conditions it finds within fonts, such
     as extraneous control characters.

-ss   Suppress the  instructions sseerrvveerrddiicctt and eexxiittsseerrvveerr  from the output.
     Use this  option if you  wish to include  the output of  PPSSffoonntt within
     ttrrooffff output; do _n_o_t use this option if you want the cooked font to be
     resident within the printer after you download it.

_i_n_f_i_l_e is the  Adobe font file that PPSSffoonntt cooks  into PostScript.  It must
have the  suffix .ppffbb. If  you do not  name an _i_n_f_i_l_e on  the command line,
PPSSffoonntt reads the standard output.

_o_u_t_f_i_l_e names the file into which PPSSffoonntt writes its output.  By convention,
it should  have the suffix .ppss,  although this is not  required.  If you do
not name  an _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  on the  command line, PPSSffoonntt  writes to  the standard
output.
