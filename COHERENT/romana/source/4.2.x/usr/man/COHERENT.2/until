uunnttiill -- Command

Execute commands repeatedly
uunnttiill _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_1 [ ddoo _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_2 ] ddoonnee

The  shell's uunnttiill  loop executes  the commands in  _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_1. If  the exit
status is  nonzero, the  shell then executes  the commands in  the optional
_s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_2 and  repeats the  process until the  exit status of  _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_1 is
zero.  Because  the shell recognizes  a reserved word only  as the unquoted
first word of a command, both ddoo and ddoonnee must occur either unquoted at the
start of a line or preceded by `;'.

The shell  commands bbrreeaakk and  ccoonnttiinnuuee may be  used to alter  control flow
within an  uunnttiill loop.  The contruct  wwhhiillee has the same  form as uunnttiill but
the sense of the test is reversed.

The shell executes uunnttiill directly.
