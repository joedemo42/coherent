uunnmmkkffss -- Command

Construct a prototype file system
uunnmmkkffss [-_p_r_e_f_i_x] _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y _n_b_l_o_c_k_s [_f_i_l_e]

uunnmmkkffss scans _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y and builds  prototype files with which you can build
file systems on backup disks.

If _p_r_e_f_i_x is given, it creates files _p_r_e_f_i_x.pp0011, _p_r_e_f_i_x.pp0022, etc.  If it is
not given, uunnmmkkffss writes its output to the standard-output device.

_n_b_l_o_c_k_s gives  the maximum  size of  a prototype file.   COHERENT currently
defines a  block as being  512 bytes (half  a kilobyte); thus,  to make the
maximum size of a prototype file ten kilobytes, set _n_b_l_o_c_k_s to 20.

The _f_i_l_e  option tells uunnmmkkffss to  suppress all files in  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y that are
older than _f_i_l_e.  If it is not used, then  uunnmmkkffss builds prototypes for all
files in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

uunnmmkkffss provides a useful way to back up file systems onto floppy disks.  To
do this, perform the following steps:

11. uunnmmkkffss a directory, producing prototype files.

22. Format one floppy disk for each prototype file.

33. Using the  prototype files  in sucession,  mmkkffss each floppy  disk.  This
   puts the indicated files onto floppy disk, preserving links.

Later, you  can use  the command  ccppddiirr to restore  all the files  from the
floppy disks, or you can use ccpp to restore individual files.

uunnmmkkffss builds  a file  system in  memory as it  does its work.   With large
directory structures, it can run out of memory.
