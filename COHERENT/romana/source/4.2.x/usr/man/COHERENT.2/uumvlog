Archive UUCP log files
uuuummvvlloogg _d_a_y_s

uuuummvvlloogg  copies all  UUCP  log files  into  backup files,  named for  their
respective commands and the date upon which the backup was performed.  _d_a_y_s
gives the number of days for which backup files should be kept: if a backup
file is more than _d_a_y_s days old, then uuuummvvlloogg will delete it.

This command should be run by ccrroonn, because the UUCP log files can threaten
to exhaust available  file space on a small system  unless they are chopped
back daily.

_N_o_t_e_s
uuuummvvlloogg  manages  the   log  files  under  directory  /usr/spool/uucp/.Log.
However, it does not  touch the files in /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin.  These can
grow quite large if unattended.  At present, you must manage these files by
hand.
