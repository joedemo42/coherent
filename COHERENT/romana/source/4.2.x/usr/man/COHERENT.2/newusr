/eettcc/nneewwuussrr _l_o_g_i_n "_U_s_e_r _N_a_m_e" _p_a_r_e_n_t_d_i_r [ _s_h_e_l_l ]

nneewwuussrr adds  a new user to  the system.  It automatically  adds an entry to
the file  /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd, creates a home directory for  the user, installs the
user in  the mail system, and otherwise performs  the myriad tasks required
to add a new user to your COHERENT system.

_l_o_g_i_n is  the login idenifier  of the new  user.  This is a  single word in
lower case,  by which that  user is identified.   Note that each  user must
have a  unique login identifier.  Identifiers are  usually the user's first
name,  initials,  or  a nickname.   _p_a_r_e_n_t_d_i_r  is  the  directory or  (more
usually) the  file system in which  nneewwuussrr will create the  new user's home
directory.  _U_s_e_r  _N_a_m_e is  the name  of the human  for whom _l_o_g_i_n  is being
created.  _s_h_e_l_l names the shell to be used; the default is the Bourne shell
/bbiinn/sshh.

For example, the command

    /etc/newusr batman "Bruce Wayne" /v /usr/bin/ksh

creates new user Bruce  Wayne, with login bbaattmmaann, home directory /vv/bbaattmmaann,
and default shell /uussrr/bbiinn/kksshh.
