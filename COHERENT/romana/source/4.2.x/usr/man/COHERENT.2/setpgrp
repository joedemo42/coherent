sseettppggrrpp() -- System Call (libc)

Make a process a process-group leader
iinntt sseettppggrrpp()

sseettppggrrpp() sets the requesting process's process-group identifier to its own
process identifier.   This detaches the  process from its  parent group and
makes it  the leader of  its own processing  group.  If the  process is not
already  a  process-group  leader,  it  is  detached from  its  controlling
terminal.

sseettppggrrpp() returns the new process-group identifier.
