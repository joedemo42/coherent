qqffiinndd -- Command

Quickly find all files with a given name
qqffiinndd [-aaddppvv] _n_a_m_e ...
qqffiinndd [-bbvv] [-ss_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]

The command qqffiinndd prints the full path name of each file with a given _n_a_m_e.
It reads  a prebuilt data  base, for the  sake of speed.   This makes qqffiinndd
much faster than ffiinndd for locating a file; but it does mean that changes to
the file system since the data  base was last updated will not be reflected
in what qqffiinndd prints.

The option -bb tells qqffiinndd to  build its data base in file /uussrr/aaddmm/qqffffiilleess.
By default, this data base names every file in your system.  If you wish to
suppress a  directory, name it with  the -ss option.  For  example, to build
the data base but suppress the directory /uussrr/ssppooooll, use the command:

    qfind -b -s/usr/spool

This command  excludes the contents of directory /uussrr/ssppooooll  and all of its
children from the qqffiinndd data base.

When invoked without the -bb option,  qqffiinndd reads its data base to find file
names.

Normally, qqffiinndd  prints the  full path  name of each  file in  the COHERENT
system that  ends with  the given  _n_a_m_e (as it  was when you  last executed
qqffiinndd -bb.) With the -dd option, qqffiinndd prints matching directories instead of
files.  With  the -aa option, qqffiinndd prints both  matching files and matching
directories.

Option  -pp specifies  partial  name matching.   For example,  qqffiinndd -pp  ffoooo
matches files /ssrrcc/ffoooo.cc and /ddoocc/ffoooo.rr as well as file /uussrr/bbiinn/ffoooo.

Finally, option -vv tells qqffiinndd to print verbose output.

_N_o_t_e_s
Building the  qqffiinndd data  base with  the -bb option  is slow, but  it speeds
finding files.  You may find it  convenient to use ccrroonn to execute qqffiinndd -bb
to rebuild the  data base at night, or some  other time when the machine is
otherwise idle.

If you want to include all  files in the data base, the superuser rroooott must
run qqffiinndd -bb.
