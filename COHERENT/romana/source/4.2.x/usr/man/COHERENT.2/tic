ttiicc -- Command

Compile a terminfo description
ttiicc [-vv[_n]] _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e

The command ttiicc compiles a _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e of tteerrmmiinnffoo information into a binary
object.

_s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e must be self-contained, i.e., it may not contain ``use'' entries
that refer to terminals not described fully in the same file.

The object  files generated by ttiicc are  normally placed into subdirectories
of the directory /uussrr/lliibb/tteerrmmiinnffoo. If the environment variable TTEERRMMIINNFFOO is
defined, it is assumed to name an alternative directory to use.

The flag -vv_n tells ttiicc to output debugging and tracing information.  _n sets
the amount of debugging information to produce, as follows:

    1   Names of files created
    2   Information related to the ``use'' facility
    3   Statistics from the hashing algorithm
    5   String-table memory allocations
    7   Entries into the string-table
    8   List of tokens encountered by scanner
    9   All values computed in construction of the hash table

_n is set to one by default.
