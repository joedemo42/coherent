ttmmppnnaamm() -- STDIO Function (libc)

Generate a unique name for a temporary file
#iinncclluuddee <ssttddiioo.hh>

ttmmppnnaamm()  constructs a  unique  name for  a  file.  The  names returned  by
ttmmppnnaamm() generally are  mechanical concatenations of letters, and therefore
are mostly used to name temporary  files, which are never seen by the user.
A file named by ttmmppnnaamm()  does not automatically disappear when the program
exits.  You must  explicitly remove it before the program  ends if you want
it to disappear.

_n_a_m_e points to the buffer into which ttmmppnnaamm() writes the name it generates.
If _n_a_m_e  is set to NULL,  ttmmppnnaamm() writes the name  into an internal buffer
that may be overwritten each time you call this function.

ttmmppnnaamm()  returns a  pointer  to the  temporary name.   Unlike the  related
function  tteemmppnnaamm(),  ttmmppnnaamm()  assumes that  the  temporary  file will  be
written into directory /ttmmpp and builds the name accordingly.

_N_o_t_e_s
If you want the file name to be written into _b_u_f_f_e_r, you should allocate at
least LL_ttmmppnnaamm  bytes of memory for  it; LL_ttmmppnnaamm is defined  in the header
ssttddiioo.hh. Under COHERENT, it is 64 characters long.
