The  term  ``POSIX  Standard''  refers  to  the Portable  Operating  System
Interface  (POSIX)  standard,  published  by  the  International  Standards
Organization (ISO) in 1990 as its standard 9945-1.  It is based on standard
1003.1 published  in 1988 by  the Institute for  Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE).

The POSIX  Standard is built upon the documentation  for the UNIX Operating
System published originally by  AT&T Bell Laboratories (now by Unix Systems
Laboratories).  It  defines a  common set of  guidelines to which  UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems like  COHERENT should adhere in order to ensure
common  functionality, and  to maximize  the portability  of code  from one
operating system  to another.  The  publication of the POSIX  Standard is a
long step towards maintaining the  openness of the UNIX family of operating
systems.
