ppccllffoonntt -- Command

Prepare a PCL font for downloading via MLP
ppccllffoonntt [-ff _n] _f_o_n_t [... _f_o_n_t] > _o_u_t_p_u_t_f_i_l_e

The command ppccllffoonntt prepares each  _f_o_n_t for downloading via the MLP spooler
to a  printer that  runs the  Hewlett-Packard Page Control  Language (PCL).
_f_o_n_t  must give  the  full path  name  of a  PCL  bitmapped ``soft  font''.
ppccllffoonntt brackets each  _f_o_n_t with the PCL commands that  tell the printer to
load the  font into  a given ``slot''  in its memory,  and to let  the font
reside permanently  in memory.  It writes the altered  _f_o_n_t to the standard
output.

The  option -ff names  the slot  into which  you want to  load _f_o_n_t.  If the
command  line names  more  than _f_o_n_t,  ppccllffoonntt  sequentially assigns  slots
beginning with  slot _n. If  you do not  use the option  -ff, ppccllffoonntt assigns
slots beginning with slot 1.

The processed fonts can either be piped to the command llpp or written into a
file  for later  downloading.  When  downloaded  via llpp,  you must  use the
device hhpprraaww. For  example, to download fonts ttrr224400bbppnn.uusspp and oopp224400bbppnn.uusspp
into slots 16 and 17 on your printer, use the command:

    pclfont -f 16 tr240bpn.usp op240bpn.usp | lp -d hpraw
