ttoouucchh -- Command

Update modification time of a file
ttoouucchh [ -cc ] _f_i_l_e ...

COHERENT keeps  track of when  each file was last  modified.  ttoouucchh changes
the modification time of each _f_i_l_e to the current time, but does not modify
its contents.  By default, ttoouucchh creates _f_i_l_e if it does not already exist;
the -cc flag suppresses this.
