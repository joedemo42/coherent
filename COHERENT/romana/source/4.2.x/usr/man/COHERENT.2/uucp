UUUUCCPP -- Overview

Unattended communication with remote systems

_U_U_C_P stands  for ``UNIX to  UNIX copy''.  It  is a system  of commands that
allows you  to exchange files  with other COHERENT  or UNIX systems,  in an
unattended manner.   With UUCP, you can send mail  to other systems, upload
files,  and execute  commands.  When configured  correctly, UUCP  also lets
other users  upload files to your  system, copy files from  it, and execute
commands.  All this can be done  without your having to sit at your console
and type commands; thus, files can  be transferred in the small hours, when
telephone rates are lower and computers are relatively free.

UUCP gives  you access  to the  Usenet, a nation-wide  network of  UNIX and
COHERENT users.  Access  to the Usenet will let you  exchange mail with any
of the  thousands of Usenet users, receive mail  from them, download source
code  for many  useful programs,  and  read the  latest news  on a  host of
subjects.   For  details on  contacting  UUNET,  a commercially  accessible
Usenet site, enter the command:

Beginning with  release 4.2, COHERENT  implements the Taylor  UUCP package.
Taylor  UUCP  offers  extraordinary  flexibility,  beyond that  offered  by
standard  implementations of  UUCP.   At present,  COHERENT implements  the
following  portions  of  Taylor UUCP:  uuuucciiccoo,  uuuuccpp,  uuuuxx, uuuuxxqqtt,  uuuunnaammee,
uuuucchheecckk, and ccuu. It also offers the commands uuuueennccooddee, uuuuddeeccooddee, uuuuiinnssttaallll,
and uuuuttrryy to supplement the Taylor package.

UUCP is  implemented through a suite of commands  and files.  The following
Lexicon entries describe UUCP:

ddiiaall........ Describe how uuuucciiccoo and ccuu can dial a modem
ppoorrtt........ File that links serial ports with dialers
ssyyss......... Describes systems contacted by UUCP
uuuucchheecckk..... Check UUCP configuation
uuuucciiccoo...... Communicate with a remote site
uuuuccpp........ Spool files for transmission to other systems
uuuuccppnnaammee.... Set the system's UUCP name
uuuuddeeccooddee.... Decode a binary file sent from a remote system
uuuueennccooddee.... Encode a binary file for transmission
uuuuiinnssttaallll... Install or modify UUCP
uuuulloogg....... Read a UUCP log
uuuummvvlloogg..... Archive UUCP log files
uuuunnaammee...... List UUCP names of known systems
uuuuttoouucchh..... Touch a file to trigger uucico poll
uuuuttrryy....... Debugging tool for UUCP
uuuuxx......... Execute a command on a remote system
uuuuxxqqtt....... Execute commands requested by a remote system

UUCP uses the following files:

/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss
     This file contains information  about remote UUCP sites with which you
     can  communicate.  uuuucciiccoo  uses its information  to connect  to remote
     systems;  sets permissions  for the  directories  that a  given remote
     system  can write  into  or read  from; establishes  the protocol  (or
     protocols) that  can be used when communicating  with the given remote
     system to transfer files.

/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ddiiaall
     uuuucciiccoo uses the information in this file to communicate with modems.

/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ppoorrtt
     uuuucciiccoo uses  the information in this file to  communicate with a given
     port on your system.

/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/.AAddmmiinn/aauuddiitt.llooccaall
     uuuucciiccoo writes its debug information into this file.

/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/.AAddmmiinn/xxffeerrssttaattss
     This stores the transfer rates of files received or transmitted.

/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/_s_i_t_e_n_a_m_e/TTMM*
/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/.TTeemmpp/_s_i_t_e_n_a_m_e*
     These  are temporary  files  that uuuucciiccoo  generates  when it  receives
     files.

The following gives the correct permissions for the files that comprise the
UUCP system:

    -r--------  /usr/lib/uucp/dial
    -r--------  /usr/lib/uucp/port
    -r--------  /usr/lib/uucp/sys
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/lib/uucp/uucico
    -r-xr-xr-x  /usr/lib/uucp/uumvlog
    -r-xr-xr-x  /usr/lib/uucp/uurmlock
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/lib/uucp/uutouch
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/lib/uucp/uuxqt
    -r-s--s---  /usr/bin/uucheck
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/bin/uucp
    -r-x--x--x  /usr/bin/uudecode
    -r-x--x--x  /usr/bin/uuencode
    -r-s--s---  /usr/bin/uuinstall
    -r-x--x--x  /usr/bin/uulog
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/bin/uuname
    -r-x------  /usr/bin/uutry
    -r-s--s--x  /usr/bin/uux

Most of  these files are owned  by user and group  uuuuccpp. The exceptions are
uuuuttrryy, which  is owned by user  and group rroooott; and  uuuueennccooddee and uuuuddeeccooddee,
which are owned by user and group bbiinn.

Permissions should  be set correctly  by COHERENT when you  installed it on
your computer.   However, if permissions are  somehow set incorrectly, UUCP
will  not work  because much  of its  work depends upon  its being  able to
create and delete files in certain restricted directories.

Should a file's permissions be  ``stepped on'' for whatever reason, you can
use the command cchhmmoodd to restore  them.  Likewise, should the group or user
who ``owns'' a  file or directory be changed for  whatever reason, you (or,
to be more  exact, the superuser rroooott can use  the commands cchhggrrpp and cchhoowwnn
to restore proper ownership.  For details on how to use these commands, see
their entry in the Lexicon.
