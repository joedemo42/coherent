The command  llooggiinn normally displays the  contents of file $HHOOMMEE/.llaassttllooggiinn
when you  log in.  This file  holds the date and time  that you last logged
into your COHERENT system.

If this file does not exist,  llooggiinn assumes that you are logging in for the
first  time,  and executes  the  script  /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/wweellccoommee. This  script
displays information about COHERENT, to  help welcome you to it and provide
you with a ``friendly'' environment.

For information on  what this file does, you should  read it.  If you wish,
you can  modify this file to  suit the layout and  special features of your
system.
