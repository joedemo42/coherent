pprrppss -- Command

Prepare files for PostScript-compatible printer
pprrppss [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_f_i_l_e ... ]

pprrppss  invokes a  driver  for a  PostScript-compatible  device, typically  a
printer such  as an Apple LaserWriter or a  Hewlett-Packard LaserJet with a
PostScript cartridge.  It generates a PostScript program listing each input
_f_i_l_e and writes it to the standard output.  If no _f_i_l_e is given, pprrppss reads
the standard input.

The PostScript  output program generates a sequence of  standard 8.5 by 11-
inch pages, each containing a header line (filename, current time and date,
and page  number) and  a box  that encloses the  text of _f_i_l_e.  The default
output typeface is ten-point Courier.

The most  common use of pprrppss  is to print output  via /ddeevv/hhpp. For example,
the command

    prps file.c file.doc | hpr -B

pipes the  output from  pprrppss into  hhpprr (the print  spooler for  /ddeevv/hhpp) to
generate a listing of ffiillee.cc and ffiillee.ddoocc.

pprrppss recognizes the following options:

-bb   Suppress  the  box around  the  page  text.  If  the  box is  present,
     PostScript clips text that would extend beyond its right border.

-hh   Suppress the header line.

-ii_n  Indent the left margin by an additional _n characters.

-ll   Generate ``landscape''-format output.   pprrppss normally generates output
     pages  in ``portrait''  format  (upright 8.5  by 11  inches).  The  -ll
     option generates output pages in landscape format (11 by 8.5) instead.
     This option is useful for files with long lines; by default, it prints
     46 lines per page.

-ll22  Generate landscape-format output  pages that each contain two side-by-
     side  ``pages'' of  text.   This format  is useful  for saving  paper,
     especially when  used with a  small size of  type.  As it  prints in a
     small size of type, it prints 66 lines per page.

-nn_n_a_m_e
     Use _n_a_m_e in place of the file name in the header line.

-tt_N  Set  tab stops  at every  _N  characters.  The  default tab  setting is
     eight.

-_p_t_s_i_z_e
     Change the size  of type to _p_t_s_i_z_e points.  By  default, pprrppss sets its
     output  in ten-point  type.  This  yields 64  lines per  normal output
     page, 46 lines in landscape format,  and 52 lines per half page in -ll22
     format.  (Note  that a ``point''  is one twelfth  of a pica,  which in
     turn is one  sixth of an inch; thus, there  are 72 points in an inch.)
     By specifying the _p_t_s_i_z_e on its command line, you can tell pprrppss to use
     a different  size of type.  For  example, -88 tells pprrppss  to use eight-
     point type.

-pp_N  Print _N lines  of text on each output page  (or half page).  Note that
     the point size determines how many  lines fit on a page, and lines per
     page determine  point size.   If you specify  both, pprrppss will  use the
     given values unless the lines do not fit at the given point size.

+_N   Skip the first _N output pages.

_S_e_t_t_i_n_g _F_o_n_t_s
pprrppss  recognizes  the  standard  nnrrooffff  font  specification  sequences  and
translates them  into PostScript font specifications.   The default font is
Courier.  Because  the naming conventions for  PostScipt fonts are anything
but uniform,  pprrppss appends a suffix  to the fontname to  designate a Roman,
boldface and italic font variety.  The default suffix is ` ' for Roman, ``-
Bold''  for bold  and  ``-Oblique'' for  italic.  These  give the  standard
PostScript names for the Courier family, ``Courier'', ``Courier-Bold'', and
``Courier-Oblique''.

Option  -ff_f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e  specifies an  alternative  _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e. Option  -FFss_X_s_u_f_f_i_x
specifies  an  alternative  font  suffix,  where  _X is  one  of  the  three
characters   RRBBII (for  RRoman, BBold  or  IItalic) and  _s_u_f_f_i_x is  the desired
suffix.  For example, the option

    -fTimes -FsR-Roman -FsI-Italic

generates  the usual  PostScript font  names for  the Times  family, namely
``Times-Roman'', ``Times-Bold'', and ``Times-Italic''.

To spare you  some of this grief, a few  fonts have built-in abbreviations.
Option  -FF_X,  where  _X  is  one  of the  characters  AABBHHNNPPSSTT,  specifies  a
PostScript fontname as follows:

    -FFAA AvantGarde
    -FFBB Bookman
    -FFHH Helvetica
    -FFNN Helvetica-Narrow
    -FFPP Palatino
    -FFSS New Century Schoolbook
    -FFTT Times

These  options also  set each  suffix appropriately  for the  desired font.
However, font naming  conventions may differ on various PostScript devices;
examine the pprrppss output and your device documentation if problems occur.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
pprrppss  is especially  useful  as a  way  of printing  the  output of  nnrrooffff,
including manual pages.  For example,

    man prps | prps | hpr -B

or

    man prps | prps -l2 | hpr -B

prints  this Lexicon  article in, respectively,  portrait mode  or two-page
landscape mode.  It looks nicer if you center the output with an indent:

    man prps | prps -i8 | hpr -B

or

    man prps | prps -l2 -i4 | hpr -B
