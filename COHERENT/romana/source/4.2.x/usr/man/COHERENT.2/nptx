nnppttxx -- Command

Generate permutations of users' full names
nnppttxx

The command  nnppttxx reads  an address/name  pair (that is,  an address  and a
user's full  name), and prints on the standard  output as many permutations
of the user's name as it can think of, each linked to the given address.  A
set of  such permutations helps  to relieve a  user of needing  to know the
exact form  of another  user's name  when she wishes  to send mail  to that
user.

When a  set of users'  names are filtered  through nnppttxx, its  output can be
used as  a ``full-name data  base'' that can  be used by  the COHERENT mail
system.

The format of an input line is:

    address name

_a_d_d_r_e_s_s can  contain any address.   It is terminated by  a <ttaabb> character.
_n_a_m_e consists of  white-space-separated names or initials, with an optional
nickname given in parentheses,  terminated by either a newline character or
a comma.

nnppttxx prints all permutations of the first names and initials, with the last
name  appearing  in  each  permutation.   Permutations are  not  necesarily
unique.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
Given the address/name pair

    chicago!widget!lc   LaMonte Cranston(Shadow)

nnppttxx produces the following set of permutations:

    Cranston        chicago!widget!lc
    L.Cranston      chicago!widget!lc
    LaMonte.Cranstonchicago!widget!lc
    S.Cranston      chicago!widget!lc
    Shadow.Cranston chicago!widget!lc

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, mmaaiill, mmkkffnnaammeess, ppaatthhss

_N_o_t_e_s
The command  mmkkffnnaammeess can read  a file of  names and massage  them into the
form expected by nnppttxx.

nnppttxx assumes  European-style names, i.e.,  that the family  name comes last
(unlike Oriental names, in which the family name comes first).
