uuuucciiccoo -- Command

Communicate with a remote site
/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/uuuucciiccoo [-DD] [-cc_s_i_t_e] [-II_f_i_l_e] [-pp_p_o_r_t] [-rr00] [-rr11] [-ss_s_i_t_e] [-SS_s_i_t_e] [-xx_l_e_v_e_l]

The UUCP daemon uuuucciiccoo is the program that communicates with a remote _s_i_t_e.
It  either  contacts another  site  and issues  commands  for execution  by
another uuuucciiccoo process on that  remote system (_m_a_s_t_e_r mode); or it receives
a call  from a  remote system  and executes the  commands that  that system
issues (_s_l_a_v_e mode).

The commands  uuuuccpp and uuuuxx  invoke uuuucciiccoo automatically,  usually in master
mode.  uuuucciiccoo  can also be invoked  directly from the shell,  from within a
script, or from with a ccrroonn file.

You can also name uuuucciiccoo in  file /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd as the default process to run
for a  given login identifier.  A  system that logs in  under that login ID
(presumably, a  version of  uuuucciiccoo on a  remote system) will  interact with
your system's  uuuucciiccoo, instead  of a shell.   When invoked in  this manner,
uuuucciiccoo runs in slave mode by default.

After uuuucciiccoo has finished  communicating with the remote system, it invokes
the daemon uuuuxxqqtt to execute the  commands issued by the remote system.  For
information on uuuuxxqqtt, see its Lexicon entry.

uuuucciiccoo recognizes the following command-line options:

-cc_s_i_t_e  Poll _s_i_t_e only if files are queued for transmission to it.  This is
        useful for invoking  uuuucciiccoo through  a ccrroonn, rather  than embedding
        contact times in the file ssyyss.

-DD      Do not detach  from the  device until the  contact with  the remote
        system concludes.

-II _f_i_l_e
        Read configuration  information  from  _f_i_l_e,  instead  of from  the
        default file /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss.

-qq      Quiet: do not invoke daemon uuuuxxqqtt on the remote system.

-pp_p_o_r_t  Use _p_o_r_t.  When used  with the options -ss or -SS,  dial out on _p_o_r_t;
        this  overrides  the  default  port  used  with  the  system  being
        contacted.

-rr00     Act as slave in  polling process; that is, carry  out the orders of
        another uuuucciiccoo that has dialed into your system.

-rr11     Act as  master in  polling process;  that is,  dial out  to another
        system and give it orders.  This is the default.

-ss_s_i_t_e  Call _s_i_t_e. This must name one of the entries in /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss.

-SS_s_i_t_e  Call _s_i_t_e immediately.  This must be  a site described in file ssyyss.
        Unlike the -ss option,  this option forces uuuucciiccoo  to telephone _s_i_t_e
        even if the current time is not specified as valid in ssyyss.

-xx_t_y_p_e[,_t_y_p_e,...,ttyyppee]
-XX_t_y_p_e[,_t_y_p_e,...,ttyyppee]
        Log a given _a_c_t_i_v_i_t_y.  These logs can help  you debug problems with
        UUCP.  uuuucciiccoo recognizes the following activities:

             aabbnnoorrmmaall       cchhaatt           hhaannddsshhaakkee
             uuuuccpp-pprroottoo     pprroottoo          ppoorrtt
             ccoonnffiigg         ssppoooollddiirr       eexxeeccuuttee
             iinnccoommiinngg       oouuttggooiinngg

        One -xx option can name multiple activities, separated by commas.  A
        uuuucciiccoo command line can contain more than -xx option.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
To poll  the site  mmwwccbbbbss (the Mark  Williams bulletin board)  five minutes
after each hour, put the following entry into a ccrroonn file:

     05 * * * * /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -smwcbbs -r1
