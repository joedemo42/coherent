pphhoonnee -- Command

Print numbers and addresses from phone directory
pphhoonnee _p_e_r_s_o_n ...

The command  pphhoonnee searches a number of telephone  directory files for each
_p_e_r_s_o_n argument  that is given.  Any  lines that matches any  of the _p_e_r_s_o_n
arguments is printed.   Typically, such lines contain the telephone number,
name,  and address  of  a person  or organization.   Lower-case letters  in
_p_e_r_s_o_n can be matched by both  the same letter and the corresponding upper-
case letter in the phone directory.

The user may supply his own phone directory by setting the (exported) shell
variable  PPHHOONNEEBBOOOOKK, to  the name  of that  file.  If  given, this  file is
searched first.  Then, the system-wide phone book is always searched.
