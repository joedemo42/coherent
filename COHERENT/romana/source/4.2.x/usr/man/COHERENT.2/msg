mmssgg -- Kernel Module

Kernel module for messages

The  kernel module  mmssgg enables  System V-style messages.   It is  called a
_k_e_r_n_e_l _m_o_d_u_l_e  because you can link  it into your kernel  or exclude it, as
you wish,  just like a device  driver; yet it is not  a true device devicer
because it does not perform I/O with a peripheral device.
