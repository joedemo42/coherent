wwhhoo -- Command

Print who is logged in
wwhhoo [_f_i_l_e] [aamm ii]

The command  wwhhoo prints  the names of  the users who  are logged in  to the
system.  For each user, wwhhoo prints her name, terminal name, login date, and
login time.  The form wwhhoo aamm ii prints this information only about yourself.

If  _f_i_l_e  is  specified,  wwhhoo  uses  it  instead  of  /eettcc/uuttmmpp  to  obtain
information about who is logged in.   This is useful, for example, with the
file /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp,  which contains a continuous  record of logins, logouts
and reboots.  When _f_i_l_e is specified, wwhhoo displays logouts; otherwise, they
are suppressed.
