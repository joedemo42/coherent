mmkkffnnaammeess -- Command

Generate data base of user names
mmkkffnnaammeess [_n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e  ...]

mmkkffnnaammeess reads the contents of _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e and writes to the standard output a
sorted data  base  that the command  mmaaiill can use as its  data base of full
users' names.  The command nnppttxx defines the format of an input line.

If no  _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e_s are  named on  the command line,  mmkkffnnaammeess reads  the file
/eettcc/ppaasssswwdd, and  attempts to parse its contents into  the form required by
nnppttxx.

mmkkffnnaammeess is usually  used to generate /uussrr/lliibb/mmaaiill/ffuullllnnaammeess. If more than
one login account  has the same part of a  name (i.e., the same last name),
the lexicographically first login name will be used.
