wwaallll -- Command

Send a message to all logged-in users
/eettcc/wwaallll

wwaallll  types a  message to  every  user currently  logged into  the COHERENT
system, with the  exception of the sender.  It can  be used to inform users
of information of general interest; for example, that man has landed on the
moon, or that the system is going down in 15 minutes.

wwaallll reads the message to be broadcast from the standard input until end of
file.   When  it  sends  the  message,  it  prefaces  it  with  the  herald
``Broadcast  message ...'',  which includes an  audible warning.   Only the
superuser should  invoke /eettcc/wwaallll (to  override access protections  of the
target terminals).
