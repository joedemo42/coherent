zzccaatt -- Command

Concatenate a compressed file
zzccaatt [ _f_i_l_e.ZZ ... ]

zzccaatt uncompresses  each _f_i_l_e  ``on the  fly,'' and prints  the uncompressed
text onto the standard output.  Each  _f_i_l_e must have been compressed by the
command ccoommpprreessss and have the suffix .ZZ.

If the command  line names no _f_i_l_e, zzccaatt uncompresses  matter read from the
standard input.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
zzccaatt is  useful for extracting selected items from  archives; it spares you
the overhead of having to uncompress  the entire archive just to get at one
or two  files.  For example, to extract mmyyffiillee  from the compressed archive
bbaacckkuupp.ttaarr.ZZ, use the following command line:

    zcat backup.tar.Z | tar xvf - myfile

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, ccoommpprreessss, rraamm, uunnccoommpprreessss

_N_o_t_e_s
Older versions of zzccaatt could only uncompress files that had been compressed
with option  -bb1122 or lower, with  -bb1122 being the default  if the option was
omitted.  Beginning with release 3.1 of COHERENT, zzccaatt can handle values up
to -bb1166.
