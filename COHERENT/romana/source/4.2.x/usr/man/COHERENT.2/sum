ssuumm -- Command

Print checksum of a file
ssuumm [_f_i_l_e ...]

ssuumm prints an unsigned integer checksum  and a size in blocks (rounding up)
for each  _f_i_l_e specified.   If more  than one _f_i_l_e  is specified,  ssuumm also
prints the  file name.   If no  _f_i_l_e is specified,  ssuumm reads  the standard
input.

ssuumm may  be used to verify  the integrity of data  transferred across phone
lines or stored on an unreliable medium.
