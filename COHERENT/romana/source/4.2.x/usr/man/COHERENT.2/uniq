uunniiqq -- Command

Remove/count repeated lines in a sorted file
uunniiqq [-ccdduu] [-_n] [+_n] [_i_n_f_i_l_e[_o_u_t_f_i_l_e]]

uunniiqq reads  input line  by line from  _i_n_f_i_l_e and writes  all non-duplicated
lines to  _o_u_t_f_i_l_e. The input file  must be sorted.  uunniiqq  uses the standard
input  or output  if either  _i_n_f_i_l_e or _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  is omitted.   The following
describes the available options:

-cc   Print each  line once, discarding  duplicate lines; before  each line,
     print the number of times it appears within the file.

-dd   Print only lines that are  duplicated within the file; print each line
     only once; do not print any counts.

-uu   Print only lines that are _n_o_t duplicated within the file.

uunniiqq by default  behaves as if both -uu and  -dd were specified, so it prints
each unique line once.

Optional specifiers allow uunniiqq to  skip leading portions of the input lines
when comparing for uniqueness.

-_n   Skip _n fields of each input  line, where a field is any number of non-
     white  space  characters  surrounded  by  any  number of  white  space
     characters (blank or tab).

+_n   Skip _n characters in each input line, after skipping fields as above.
