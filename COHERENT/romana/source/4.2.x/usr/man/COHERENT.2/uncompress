uunnccoommpprreessss -- Command

Uncompress a compressed file
uunnccoommpprreessss [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

uunnccoommpprreessss uncompressses one or more  _f_i_l_es that had been compressed by the
command ccoommpprreessss.

Each _f_i_l_e's  name must have  the suffix .ZZ,  which was appended  onto it by
ccoommpprreessss; otherwise,  uunnccoommpprreessss prints an  error message and  exits.  When
uunnccoommpprreessss  has uncompressed  a _f_i_l_e,  it removes the  .ZZ suffix  from that
file's name.

If no _f_i_l_e is specified on the command line, uunnccoommpprreessss uncompresses matter
read from the standard input, and writes its output to the standard output.

Older  versions of  uunnccoommpprreessss could  only uncompress  files that  had been
compressed with  option -bb1122  or lower, with  -bb1122 being the  default.  The
edition of  uunnccoommpprreessss released with  COHERENT version 3.1  (and subsequent
versions) can handle values up to 16.
