ppuuttww() -- STDIO Function (libc)

Write word into stream
#iinncclluuddee <ssttddiioo.hh>
iinntt ppuuttww(_w_o_r_d, _f_p)
iinntt _w_o_r_d; FFIILLEE *_f_p;

ppuuttww() writes _w_o_r_d into the file stream to which _f_p points.  It returns the
value written.

ppuuttww() differs  from the  related routine ppuuttcc()  in that ppuuttww()  writes an
iinntt, whereas ppuuttcc() writes a cchhaarr that is promoted to an iinntt.

_D_i_a_g_n_o_s_t_i_c_s
ppuuttww() returns EEOOFF when an error  occurs.  You may need to call ffeerrrroorr() to
distinguish this value from a genuine end-of-file flag.

_N_o_t_e_s
Because ppuuttww() is  implemented as a macro as well  as a function, arguments
with side effects may not work  as expected.  The bytes of _w_o_r_d are written
in the natural byte order of the machine.
