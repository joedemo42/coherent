uuuueennccooddee -- Command

Encode a binary file for transmission
uuuueennccooddee [ _s_o_u_r_c_e ] _f_i_l_e__l_a_b_e_l [ < _s_o_u_r_c_e ] > _o_u_t_p_u_t

uuuueennccooddee prepares a file for transmission to a remote destination via uuuuccpp.
It  takes  binary input  and  produces an  encoded  version, consisting  of
printable ASCII characters, on  standard output, which may be redirected or
piped to uuuuccpp.

If _s_o_u_r_c_e is not specified, uuuueennccooddee reads the standard input and writes to
the  standard  output.   If, however,  _s_o_u_r_c_e  is  specified, uuuueennccooddee  its
permissions into the uuuueennccooddee'd file.  _f_i_l_e__l_a_b_e_l is the name that uuuuddeeccooddee
gives to the file when it is decoded.

uuuueennccooddee is chiefly used for mail.   You cannot mail a binary file, but you
can mail  a uuuueennccooddee'd  binary.  The  standard way to  mail a binary  is to
compress it, uuuunneeccooddee it, split it into pieces less than 50 kilobytes each,
then mail each piece.

The format of the encoded file is as follows:

11. A _h_e_a_d_e_r  line starting with  the characters bbeeggiinn followed  by a space.
   This is  followed by the mode  of the file in octal and  the name of the
   output  file  specified on  the  command line.   (For  details, see  the
   Lexicon entry for cchhmmoodd). These last  two fields are also separated by a
   space.  The  mode and the  system name can  be changed by  directing the
   output into a file and editing it.

22. The _b_o_d_y of the file, consisting of a number of lines, each no more than
   62  characters long,  including a newline  character.  Each  line starts
   with a character count written as a single ASCII character, representing
   an integer value  from 0 (octal 40) to 63  (octal 135) giving the number
   of characters in the rest of  the line.  This is followed by the encoded
   characters  and  a  newline.  The  last  line  of  the  body is  a  line
   consisting of an ASCII space (octal 40).

33. A _t_r_a_i_l_e_r, which consists of the string eenndd on a line by itself.

The  encoding is  done  by taking  three  bytes and  storing  them in  four
characters,  six bits  per  character.  Each  six  bits is  converted to  a
printable character by adding 0x20 to it.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
Consider the file ttmmpp, which consists of the line:

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

To record it in file ttmmpp.sseenndd, type:

    uuencode tmp < tmp > tmp.send

The output is:

    begin 644 tmp
    M5&AE('%U:6-K(&)R;W=N(&9O>"!J=6UP<R!O=F5R('1H92!L87IY(&1O9RX*

    end

Note that the third line consists of a space followed by a newline.

_N_o_t_e_s
uuuueennccooddee expands  a file by  more than one  third, which in  turn increases
transmission time.  This can be a factor when sending large files.
