ttttyyttyyppee -- Command

Select a default terminal type for a port
ttttyyttyyppee

The command ttttyyttyyppee selects a default terminal type for a given port.

The default terminal types are recorded in file /eettcc/ttttyyttyyppee. You must edit
this  file  to  ensure  that  the  default  terminal  types  are  described
correctly.  The following gives a example version of /eettcc/ttttyyttyyppee:

    ansipc    console    The COHERENT console
    adm3a     com1l      The old Kaypro II
    vt100     com2r      Remote logins

The  first string  gives the  type of  terminal.  This  string must  name a
terminal that is recognized by tteerrmmccaapp and tteerrmmiinnffoo The second string gives
the device  with which  this terminal type  is linked.  The  ccoonnssoollee device
should  always be  linked to  terminal  type aannssiippcc.  Other devices  can be
linked  to the  type of  terminal  most often  used on  them; on  the above
example, the  user has a Kaypro  II that is wired  into his COHERENT system
via a local  serial port.  ttttyyttyyppee ignores all strings  after the first two
in  each line,  so you  can add  comments to  each entry,  as in  the above
example.

You can use ttttyyttyyppee to set a terminal type automatically at login time.  To
do so, edit the file /eettcc/pprrooffiillee and replace the line

    export TERM=ansipc

with the command:

    export TERM=`/usr/bin/ttytype`
