qquuoott -- Command

Summarize file-system usage
qquuoott [ -cc ] [ -ff ] [ -nn ] [ -tt ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m

qquuoott produces several different  summaries about the ownership of files for
each  _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m  argument  given.  When  no  options  are specified,  qquuoott
produces a two-column  listing that gives the amount of  space used by each
user, sorted in decreasing order of file space used; the first column gives
the number  of blocks  used and  the second gives  the use name.   Space is
always given in blocks.

Options are  available to modify the normal output  or specify a completely
different action.

qquuoott recognizes the following options:

-cc Give  a  three-column breakdown  of  files by  size.   The first  column
   contains all  file sizes, in increasing order.   The second column gives
   the number of files of the size indicated in the first.  The third gives
   a cumulative  sum of the  sizes of all  files less than or  equal to the
   current size.

-ff Add an initial column that contains  the number of files to the front of
   the normal output.

-nn Takes as  input a  list of  i-numbers and file  names, one per  line and
   sorted  in ascending  order by  i-number; ignore all  lines not  in this
   form.  The output  is in two columns: the first  gives the owner and the
   second  contains the  file  name for  each  entry in  the output.   This
   conforms to usage with the following pipeline:

       ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot -n filesystem


-tt To the normal output, add a line that contains totals.

qquuoott runs much faster with a raw device for _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.

Only the superuser rroooott can run qquuoott.

Sparse files are recorded as if they had all of their blocks allocated.
