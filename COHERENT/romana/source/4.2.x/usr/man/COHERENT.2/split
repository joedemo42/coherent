sspplliitt -- Command

Split a text file into smaller files
sspplliitt [-_l_i_n_e_s][-cc_c_o_u_n_t][_i_n_f_i_l_e [_o_u_t_f_i_l_e] ]

sspplliitt divides  a file into a  number of smaller files.   This is especially
useful  for  dividing  text  files  into  chunks that  can  be  managed  by
MicroEMACS or  similar editors,  or for  dividing binary files  into chunks
that can be easily transmitted via UUCP.

sspplliitt  uses _i_n_f_i_l_e  as its  input  file if  given; otherwise,  it uses  the
standard input.  If _i_n_f_i_l_e is `-', sspplliitt uses the standard input.

sspplliitt  puts  its output  into  files  with names  prefixed  by _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  and
suffixed  consecutively with  aaaa, aabb,  aacc,  and so  on.  If  no _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  is
specified, file names are prefixed with xx.

Normally, sspplliitt puts 1,000 lines in  each output file.  This default may be
changed for text files by the  option -_l_i_n_e_s, where _l_i_n_e_s gives the desired
number of lines  per file.  When using sspplliitt on  binary files, the argument
_c_o_u_n_t to the  -cc option lets you specify the  number of characters to place
into each output file.
