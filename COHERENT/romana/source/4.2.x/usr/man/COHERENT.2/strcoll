ssttrrccoollll() -- String Function (libc)

Compare two strings, using locale-specific information

iinntt ssttrrccoollll(_s_t_r_i_n_g_1, _s_t_r_i_n_g_2)
cchhaarr *_s_t_r_i_n_g_1; cchhaarr *_s_t_r_i_n_g_2;

ssttrrccoollll() lexicographically compares  the string pointed to by _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 with
one pointed to by _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. Comparison ends when a null character is read.

ssttrrccoollll() compares the two strings  character by character until it finds a
pair of characters  that are not identical.  It returns  a number less than
zero  if the  character in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 is  less (i.e.,  occurs earlier  in the
character  table) than  its  counterpart in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. It  returns a  number
greater  than zero  if the  character in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1  is greater  (i.e., occurs
later  in the  character  table) than  its  counterpart in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. If  no
characters  are  found  to  differ,  then  the strings  are  identical  and
ssttrrccoollll() returns zero.

The  string-comparison routines ssttrrccoollll(),  ssttrrccmmpp(), and  ssttrrnnccmmpp() differ
from the  memory-comparison routine mmeemmccmmpp()  in that they  compare strings
rather  than regions  of  memory.  They  stop  when they  encounter a  null
character, but mmeemmccmmpp() does not.

The  ANSI  Standard's  description of  ssttrrccoollll()  emphasizes  that it  uses
locale-specific information,  as set by  the ANSI function  sseettllooccaallee(), to
perform string comparisons.  The COHERENT system has not yet implement ANSI
locales; therefore, ssttrrccoollll()  does not differ significantly from ssttrrccmmpp().
It is included to support programs written in ANSI C.
