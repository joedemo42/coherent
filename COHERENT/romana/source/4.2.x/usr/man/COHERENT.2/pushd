ppuusshhdd -- Command

Push an item onto the directory stack
ppuusshhdd [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_0 ... _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_N]

The COHERENT shell sshh maintains an internal ``directory stack'', which is a
stack of  names of directories.  You can manipulate  this stack should you,
for  any reason,  wish  to traverse  a  number of  directories quickly  and
efficiently.

The command  ppuusshhdd pushes _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_1 through  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_N onto the directory
stack, and changes the current  directory to the last directory pushed.  If
called without  an argument, it transposes the last  two directories on the
directory stack.
