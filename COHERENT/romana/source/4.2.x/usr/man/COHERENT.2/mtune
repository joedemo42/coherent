Define tunable kernel variables
/eettcc/ccoonnff/mmttuunnee

File mmttuunnee  defines all of the tunable variables  within the kernel.  These
variables let you

Command iiddmmkkccoohh reads  this file when it builds a  new kernel, and uses its
contents to help  patch the newly build kernel.  A  mmkkddeevv script (kept in a
subdirectory  of /eettcc/ccoonnff)  also  sets appropriate  variables within  this
file, based on your answers to its questions.

Each line  within mmttuunnee defines one tunable parameter.   A line consists of
four fields, as follows:

11. _N_a_m_e
     This field names the parameter.  It cannot exceed 20 characters.

22. _M_i_n_i_m_u_m _V_a_l_u_e
     The legal minimum value of this parameter.

33. _D_e_f_a_u_l_t _V_a_l_u_e
     The default value for this parameter.  This value can be overridden by
     an entry in file /eettcc/ccoonnff/ssttuunnee.

44. _M_a_x_i_m_u_m _V_a_l_u_e
     The legal maximum value of this parameter.

Note that  under UNIX System V,  fields 2 and 3 are  reversed.  A line that
begins with the pound sign `#' is a comment, and is ignored by iiddmmkkccoohh when
it builds a new kernel.

this file.

mmttuunnee contains  comments that  describe the  kernel variables that  you can
tune.  If you wish to tune the kernel, you should read this file and modify
it appropriately.  The variables are documented in this file rather than in
the COHERENT  manual to ensure  that you have  exactly accurate information
about  the variables  that reside  in  the version  of the  kernel on  your
system.
