Display text one page at a time
mmoorree [ -ccddffllssuu ] [ -_w_i_n_d_o_w__s_i_z_e ] [ +_l_i_n_e__n_u_m_b_e_r ] [ +/_p_a_t_t_e_r_n ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ] [ - ]

mmoorree is a filter for paging  through text one screenful at a time.  _f_i_l_e is
a text  file; the operator  - tells mmoorree  to read and  display the standard
input.

_O_p_t_i_o_n_s
mmoorree  reads  options  from the  command  line  and  from the  environmental
variable MMOORREE. In case of a conflict, the options given on the command line
take precedence.   Every cluster of options must be  preceded with a hyphen
`-', even if passed via the environmental variable MMOORREE.

mmoorree recognizes the following options:

-cc Paint the  screen from  the top line  down.  mmoorree normally  repaints the
   screen by scrolling from the bottom of the screen.

-dd Prompt the user at the end of each screen with the message:

       [Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]

   The default is to not issue a prompt.

-ff Count actual  lines from the input file rather  than screen lines.  This
   option is useful when the input contains escape sequences that mmoorree does
   not recognize.

-ll Do not  treat the formfeed  character <ccttrrll-LL> as  special.  By default,
   mmoorree pauses  at each formfeed  character, as if  a full screen  had been
   displayed.

-ss Squeeze consecutive blank lines into one blank line.  This is useful for
   looking at nnrrooffff output, such as manual pages.

-uu Display backspaces as  control characters and leave the carriage return-
   linefeed (CR-LF) pair  alone.  By default, mmoorree displays backspaces that
   appear  adjacent   to  an  underscore  character   as  underlined  text;
   backspaces that  appear between  two identical characters  as emboldened
   text; and compresses CR-LF sequences.

+/_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
   Search  for _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  before  displaying a  file.  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  is a  regular
   expression, as  recognized by  commands eedd  or eeggrreepp. _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  should be
   escaped to avoid being processed by the shell.

-_w_i_n_d_o_w__s_i_z_e
   Set the size of the window that mmoorree displays to _w_i_n_d_o_w__s_i_z_e, which is a
   decimal  integer less  than or  equal  to the  number of  lines on  your
   terminal.  The default window  size is read from the tteerrmmccaapp description
   for your terminal.

+_l_i_n_e__n_u_m_b_e_r
   Make _l_i_n_e__n_u_m_b_e_r the beginning  line to display in  _f_i_l_e. _l_i_n_e__n_u_m_b_e_r is
   a decimal integer less than the number of lines in _f_i_l_e.

_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s
The following  describes mmoorree's  interactive commands.  These  commands are
based on  those for  the UNIX  editor vvii. Some  commands may  optionally be
preceded by a  decimal number.  If you enter an  invalid command, mmoorree will
beep at you.

[_N]<ssppaaccee>
   Display the next _N lines of text (default, one screenful).

[_N]zz
   If _N is not specified, display the next screenful.  Otherwise, display _N
   lines and set the default scrolling size to _N for all subsequent <ssppaaccee>
   and zz commands.

[_N]<ccttrrll-FF>

9[_N]ff
   Scroll forward _N screenfuls (default, one screenful).  If _N is more than
   the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.

7
9[_N]bb
   Scroll backward  _N screenfuls  (default, one  screenful).  If _N  is more
   than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.

[_N]ss
   Skip forward _N lines (default, one line) and display one screenful.

[_N]<rreettuurrnn>

9[_N]<eenntteerr>
   Scroll forward _N  lines (default, one).  Display all _N  lines, even if _N
   is more than the screen size.

[_N]<ccttrrll-DD>

9[_N]dd
   Scroll forward _N lines (default, one  half of the screen size).  If _N is
   specified,  it becomes  the new  default for  subsequent dd  and <ccttrrll-DD>
   commands.

<ccttrrll-LL>
   Redraw the screen.

'  (Apostrophe)  Return  to the  position  in the  current  file where  the
   previous search command  started, or to the beginning of  the file if no
   search commands have occurred.  This information is lost when a new file
   is examined.

[_N]/_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
   Search forward  for the _N-th line that  contains _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (default, one).
   _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  is a  regular expression,  as  recognized by  eedd or  eeggrreepp. The
   search starts at the second line displayed.

nn  Repeat previous search.

:ff Display the name of the current file with the current line number.

[_N]:nn
   Examine the  _N-th file after the  current file, as given  in the command
   line (default, the next file).

[_N]:pp
   Examine the  _N-th file  previous to  the current file,  as given  in the
   command line (default, the previous file).

9:! _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
   Pass _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  to the shell  specified by environment  variable SSHHEELLLL for
   execution.  The default shell is /bbiinn/sshh.

vv  Invoke an  editor to edit  the current file.   The editor is  set by the
   environment  variables  VVIISSUUAALL  and EEDDIITTOORR,  in  that  order.  If  these
   variables are not set, use vvii.
