rrmmaaiill -- Command

Receive UUCP mail
rrmmaaiill [-LLllRRrr] -qq _n_u_m -uu _u_u_x_f_l_a_g_s _a_d_d_r_e_s_s ...

rrmmaaiill receives mail from UUCP.  It  reads and interprets the address on the
mail and  either delivers it on  the local machine (if this  is where it is
address to),  or passes it  on to the  next machine named  in the message's
UUCP path.

_O_p_t_i_o_n_s
The command uuuuxx can pass options to rrmmaaiill to control its behavior.  Because
rrmmaaiill and ssmmaaiill  are links to the same executable,  rrmmaaiill may be passed any
option that you can type into  ssmmaaiill; in all likelihood, however, the range
of options it  will see is much narrower.  The  following gives the options
likeliest to be passed to rrmmaaiill:

-LL Send all  addresses to the  local mailer for  processing, including UUCP
   paths.

-ll Send a  domain address  to the  local mailer for  processing.  Normally,
   only local addresses go to the local mailer.

-qq _n_u_m_b_e_r
   Set the queuing threshold to _n_u_m_b_e_r.  When routing mail to a given host,
   rrmmaaiill checks the ``cost'' of contacting  the host; this cost is given in
   /uussrr/lliibb/mmaaiill/ppaatthhss. If  the cost is  less the queueing  threshold, then
   rrmmaaiill  sends the  mail immediately;  otherwise, it  queues the  mail for
   later shipment.  Under COHERENT, default queueing threshold is 100.

-RR Reroute UUCP paths, trying successively larger righthand substrings of a
   path until a component is recognized.

-rr Route the  first component of a UUCP path  (hhoosstt!aaddddrreessss) in addition to
   routing domain addresses (uusseerr@ddoommaaiinn).

-uu _u_u_x_f_l_a_g_s
   Pass _u_u_x_f_l_a_g_s to uuuuxx for remote mail.  This overrides any of the default
   values and other queueing strategies.

-ll causes  rrmmaaiill to send all  domain addresses through the local mailer, to
process  addresses for  non-UUCP  domains.  -LL  causes rrmmaaiill  to send  even
explicit UUCP  paths through  the local mailer,  presumably to make  use of
other transport mechanisms.  In both cases, rrmmaaiill ssmmaaiill gets hold it.
