ssttuunnee -- System Administration

Set values of tunable kernel variables
/eettcc/ccoonnff/ssttuunnee

File ssttuunnee  names each  tunable variable within  the kernel, and  gives the
value to which it is actually set.  Command iiddmmkkccoohh reads this file when it
builds  a   new  kernel,  and  uses  its  contents   to  patch  the  kernel
appropriately.

Each entry  within this  file has  two fields.  The  first field  names the
variable; the name  must match that given in ssttuunnee.  The second field gives
the value  of the variable;  this value must  fall between the  minimum and
maximum values given in ssttuunnee.

If a line begins with a pound sign `#', it is a comment and iiddmmkkccoohh ignores
it.  If  a tunable  variable is  not named in  this file, iiddmmkkccoohh  uses the
default value given in ssttuunnee.
