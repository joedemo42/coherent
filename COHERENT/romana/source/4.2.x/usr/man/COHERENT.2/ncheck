nncchheecckk -- Command

Print file names corresponding to i-node
nncchheecckk [ -ii _n_u_m_b_e_r ... ] [ -aass ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...

An _i-_n_u_m_b_e_r identifies an i-node.  nncchheecckk generates a list of file names by
i-number for each _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m, which should  be the name of a device special
file that  contains a  proper COHERENT file  system.  Using the  raw device
generally decreases the time nncchheecckk requires to do its work.

The output is in the unsorted traversal order of the file system hierarchy.
nncchheecckk distinguishes directories  from files by suffixing `/.' to directory
names.

Under the -ii  option, nncchheecckk prints the file name  corresponding to each i-
number _n_u_m_b_e_r in  the given list.  Under the -aa  option, nncchheecckk prints only
the names of  special files and set user-ID mode  files; this option allows
the system administrator to ascertain quickly whether these files represent
possible security breaches.

nncchheecckk appends `??' to the generated file name if it cannot find the proper
parent structure while retrieving the file-name information.  It represents
any loops  detected in  the file name  by the characters  `...'.  Extremely
addled  file   systems  may  generate   other  reasonably  self-explanatory
diagnostics.
