vvttkkbb -- Device Driver

Non-configurable keyboard driver, virtual consoles

The device driver vvttkkbb drives the keyboard on your system's console -- that
is, the  keyboard that is plugged directly into  your computer.  Unlike the
related keyboard kkbb, vvttkkbb is used with virtual consoles.

This  driver recognizes  the standard  83-,  101-, and  102-key AT-protocol
keyboards,  using the  keyboard layout  used in  the United  States.  These
codes  are  ``hard-wired''  into  the  driver;  Unlike the  other  COHERENT
keyboard driver nnkkbb, you cannot modify these settings.

vvttkkbb  is,  in  general, more  robust  than  vvttnnkkbb  in handling  inexpensive
keyboards that do not conform fully to accepted standards.

for kkeeyybbooaarrdd.
