ttyyppeeddeeff -- C Keyword

Define a new data type

ttyyppeeddeeff  is  a C  facility  that  lets you  define  new  data types.   Such
definitions are always made in terms of existing data types; for example,

    typedef long time_t;

establishes the  data type  ttiimmee_tt, and  defines it to  be equivalent  to a
lloonngg.  By convention,  programmer-defined data types are written in capital
letters.

Judicious use of the ttyyppeeddeeff facility can make programs easier to maintain,
and improve their portability.
