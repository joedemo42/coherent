nnaapp() -- System Call (libc)

nnaapp() sleeps  for _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  milliseconds, or  until its process  receives a
signal, whichever occurs first.

If  it receives  no signal,  nnaapp()  returns the  number of  milliseconds it
slept.  If it received a signal, it returns -1 and sets eerrrrnnoo to EEIINNTTRR.

nnaapp() is governed by the  granularity of the system clock.  Under COHERENT,
the system  clock ticks every ten milliseconds; thus,  the call nnaapp(11); and
the call  nnaapp(99); have the same  effect.  Note that nnaapp()  is guaranteed to
sleep for  at least _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  milliseconds; thus, the  call nnaapp(1111); sleeps
for two clock ticks, or 20 milliseconds.
