vvttnnkkbb -- Device Driver

Configurable keyboard driver, virtual consoles

The device  driver vvttnnkkbb  drives the keyboard  on your system's  console --
that is, the keyboard that is plugged directly into your computer.

vvttnnkkbb behaves exactly like the driver  nnkkbb; the drivers differ only in that
vvttnnkkbb is used with virtual consoles.  Keystrokes are passed to it through a
configuration program  that is loaded  into it when you  boot your COHERENT
system.  You  can select among any number  of configuration programs stored
in directory  /ccoonnff/kkbbdd, or you can  create a set of  custom keymapping for
your console's  keyboard.  For  details on  how to do  so, see  the Lexicon
entry nnkkbb.

for kkeeyybbooaarrdd.
