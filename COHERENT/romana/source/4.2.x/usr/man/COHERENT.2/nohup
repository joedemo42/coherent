nnoohhuupp -- Command

Run a command immune to hangups and quits
nnoohhuupp _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]

The  command  nnoohhuupp  tells the  COHERENT  shell  to  execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  while
ignoring all hangup and quit signals.

If you  do not  redirect the  output of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d,  nnoohhuupp redirects  both the
standard  output  and  the  standard  error  into the  file  nnoohhuupp.oouutt.  If
nnoohhuupp.oouutt cannot  be created in the current  directory, nnoohhuupp redirects all
output into the file $HHOOMMEE/nnoohhuupp.oouutt.

nnoohhuupp is  often used  to execute scripts  or pipelines that  would normally
abort  if you logged out during the middle of execution.
