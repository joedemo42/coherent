ppaatttteerrnn -- Definition

A ppaatttteerrnn  is any combination of  text and wildcard characters  that can be
interpreted   by   a  command.    Patterns   are   also  called   ``regular
expressions''.

The  function ppnnmmaattcchh()  compares two patterns  and indicates  whether they
match.

For a  fuller explanation of  how to use patterns  within applications, see
the section on _E_x_p_e_r_t _E_d_i_t_i_n_g in the tutorial for the line editor eedd.
