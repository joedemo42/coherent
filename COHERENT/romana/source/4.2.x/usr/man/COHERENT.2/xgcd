xxggccdd() is an extended version of the greatest-common-division function.  It
sets  the multiple-precision  integer  (or mmiinntt)  pointed  to by  _g to  the
greatest common divisor of the mmiinntt  pointed to by _a and that pointed to by
_b. It also  sets the mmiinntts pointed to by  _r and _s so the following relation
holds:

    _g = _a x _r + _b x _s

_r, _s, and _g must all be distinct.
