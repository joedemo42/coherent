vviirreecc -- Command

Recover the modified version of a file after a crash

vviirreecc extracts the most recent version of a text file from a temporary file
in /ttmmpp.

When you edit a file with  eellvviiss, only about five kilobytes of the file are
stored in  RAM; the rest  is stored in  a file in /ttmmpp.  vviirreecc extracts the
``undo'' version from the file stored in /ttmmpp. This is most useful when the
system (or  eellvviiss) crashes in the  middle of a long  editing session, since
the  ``undo'' version  of  the file  contains everything  except your  last
change.

There are two ways to use  vviirreecc. The first, and most common, way to invoke
vviirreecc is  to give it  the name of the  file you were editing;  it finds the
matching file in  /ttmmpp and writes the newest available  version of the file
over the existing version.  It then deletes the /ttmmpp file.

The second way  is to use the `<' to  let vviirreecc read a particular /ttmmpp file
via ssttddiinn.  Use this method when  you either have forgotten  which file you
were editing  and want to see  its contents, or when you  wish to recover a
file without losing either the /ttmmpp file or the current version of the text
file.

The -dd option tells vviirreecc to  look for a temporary file in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y rather
than in /ttmmpp.
