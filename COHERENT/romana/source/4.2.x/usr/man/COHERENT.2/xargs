xxaarrggss -- Command

Execute a command with many arguments
xxaarrggss _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ... _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t

COHERENT  limits  the  amount  of  memory  available to  hold  a  command's
arguments; therefore, a command will  fail if its list of arguments exceeds
this limit.  This limit is set  by the constant BBUUFFSSIIZZ, which is defined in
the header file ssttddiioo.hh.

To  avoid this  problem, COHERENT  offers the  command xxaarrggss.  This command
executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  and passes to  it every _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.  An _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t can  be an
option  to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d,  the name  of a  file, or  anything else  that _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s
expects.  xxaarrggss  then redirects the  standard input into  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. xxaarrggss is
careful not  to exceed  the system-imposed limit,  which is expected  to be
greater  than BBUUFFSSIIZZ.  It  continues to  execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  with the  read-in
arguments until it reaches end-of-file.

The COHERENT  implementation of xxaarrggss  performs only the most  basic -- and
most important  -- behaviors  of xxaarrggss. You  must rewrite all  scripts that
depend upon  the more  exotic behaviors  of the System-V  implementation of
xxaarrggss.
