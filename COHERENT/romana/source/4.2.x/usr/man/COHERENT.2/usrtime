/eettcc/uussrrttiimmee

File /eettcc/uussrrttiimmee holds the time, day  of the week, and terminal line  upon
which a given user can log  into your COHERENT system.  Command llooggiinn reads
it to  see if a user  who is attempting to  log in is doing  at a permitted
time and via a permitted line.   If a user is not named in this file, llooggiinn
assumes that she can log in at any time, via any line.

uussrrttiimmee consists of an indefinite  number of lines, each with the following
format:

    _u_s_e_r_s:_e_n_a_b_l_e:_t_t_y:_w_e_e_k_d_a_y:_t_i_m_e:_c_o_m_m_e_n_t

The following describes each field in detail.

_u_s_e_r The login identifiers of the user or users to be restricted.  Multiple
     identifiers  must be  separated by  commas.   Each identifier  must be
     defined in  /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd. If this  field is empty,  then the line  is a
     default for every user not specifically named elsewhere in uussrrttiimmee.

     The keywords AALLLL, UUUUCCPP, SSLLIIPP, and IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE can also be used in this
     field,  to name  categories of  users.  They  are described  in detail
     below.

_e_n_a_b_l_e
     Enable or disable the  login (or logins).  NNOOLLOOGGIINN disables the login;
     LLOOGGIINN or an empty field enables it.  A range of dates of the form

         yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd

     enables logins  only during those dates.  This  field can contain more
     than one range of dates; if it does, the ranges must be separated by a
     comma.  Prefixing a range of  dates with a `!' disables logins between
     those dates.

_t_t_y  This field lists the devices via  which the user (or users) may log in
     -- usually  a ttttyy or  ccoomm device.  If  this field names  more than one
     device,  they  must  be  separated  by  commas.  one  device  must  be
     separated by commas.  A device name can contain the wildcard character
     `?'; for details on how this is interpreted, see the Lexicon entry for
     wwiillddccaarrddss. If a device is prefixed  with a `!', the user cannot log in
     on that device.   If this field is empty, then  the user can log in on
     all devices.

_w_e_e_k_d_a_y
     This field  lists the  days of  the week upon  which the the  user (or
     users)  can log  in.  If  more  than one  day is  named, they  must be
     separated  by  commas.  Each  day  is identified  by  the first  three
     letters of  its name.  If a  weekday is prefixed with  a `!', then the
     users cannot  log in on that  day.  If this field  is empty, the users
     can log in on any day of the week.

_t_i_m_e This field  gives range of time  during which the user  (or users) may
     log in.  Time is given in the form:

         hhmm-hhmm

     If more  than one range  is named, they  must be separated  by commas.
     Prefixing a range with a `!' forbids the user to log in during between
     those times.  If this field is  empty, then the user can log in during
     any time of the day.

_c_o_m_m_e_n_t
     This  field holds  some commentary, presumably  helpful to  others who
     must read this file.  llooggiinn ignores this field.

_S_c_o_p_e _o_f _E_n_t_r_i_e_s
A user may be affected by more than entry in this file.  The order in which
the entries appear is significant.

At the  top of the file  should appear the entries  that are being excluded
from restriction.  These should include  such users as bbiinn and ddaaeemmoonn, plus
any ordinary  user you wish to exclude from  being restricted.  The entries
for such a users should consist of her (its) name, followed by five colons.
Any user  named in  such an  entry is immune  to any restrictions  that may
appear below in this file.

Next should come the  global restrictions, that is, restrictions for entire
categories of  users.  As  mentioned above, you  can use the  keywords AALLLL,
UUUUCCPP,  SSLLIIPP, or  IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE to  describe users.   These keywords  have the
following meaning:

AALLLL  All users.
UUUUCCPP All ``users''  who are UUCP  accounts -- i.e.,  whose shell as  set in
     /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd is /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/uuuucciiccoo.
SSLLIIPP All ``users'' who are SLIP accounts -- i.e., whose shell is ssllllooggiinn.
IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE
     Users who have  an interactive the interactive shell kksshh  or sshh set at
     login.

Last should come entries for  individual users or clusters of users.  These
restrictions can be  set in addition to those set  for categories of users.
An entry for an individual users that appears below the global entries will
not loosen the restrictions set globally  for that user; but it can tighten
them.

Note  that  llooggiinn ignores  any  restrictions set  for  the superuser  rroooott.
Finally llooggiinn ignores every line that  begins with a `#'.  You can use such
lines to hold comments.
