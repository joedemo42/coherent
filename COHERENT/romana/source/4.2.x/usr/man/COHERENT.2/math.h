mmaatthh.hh is  the header  file to  be included with  programs that use  any of
COHERENT's  mathematics routines.  It  includes the  following: definitions
for  mathematical functions;  error  return values,  as used  by the  eerrrrnnoo
function;  definitions  of  mathematical  constants,  e.g.,  HHUUGGEE_VVAALL;  the
definition of structure ccppxx, which describes complex variables; definitions
of   internal  compiler   functions;  and,   finally,  prototypes   of  all
