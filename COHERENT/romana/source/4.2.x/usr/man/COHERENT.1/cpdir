ccppddiirr -- Command

Copy directory hierarchy
ccppddiirr [_o_p_t_i_o_n ... ] _d_i_r_1 _d_i_r_2

ccppddiirr  copies source  directory hierarchy  _d_i_r_1  to target  hierarchy _d_i_r_2,
which  is  created  if necessary.   Either  hierarchy  may straddle  device
boundaries.

ccppddiirr preserves  as much as possible of the  source structure.  Files under
_d_i_r_1 go  to identically named files under _d_i_r_2.  Links between source files
are  preserved  as links  between  corresponding  target files.   Preserved
source file  attributes include mode,  subject to the  user's file creation
mask.  If the  user is not the superuser, ccppddiirr  cannot preserve the owner,
group, and  sticky bits  in the  mode, and the  invoking user owns  all new
files; under  the superuser it  preserves these as well.   In addition, the
superuser may ``copy'' special nodes  and pipe nodes; ccppddiirr copies only the
facility, not the contents.  It  also preserves real major and minor device
numbers of special nodes.

If  the target  file corresponding  to a  source file exists  and is  not a
directory, ccppddiirr  unlinks it before copying.  This  differs from the action
of ccpp.

ccppddiirr recognizes the following options:

-aa   Give a verbose account on one line of the files copied.

-dd   Preserve the last-modified date instead of using the present date.

-ee   Print  error  message  and continue  execution  after  an error.   The
     default action is to exit on any error.

-rr [_n]
     Descend no  more than _n  levels in the source  hierarchy.  Contents of
     _d_i_r_1 are at level 1.  If missing, _n defaults to 1.

-ss _n_a_m_e
     Suppress the  copy of file _n_a_m_e,  which should be the  pathname of the
     file relative to _d_i_r_1.

-tt   Test only,  make no changes.  With this option,  ccppddiirr prints a report
     of all  errors (-ee is  implied), all unlinked target  files, and other
     useful information, including a summary of all external links into the
     target hierarchy that would have been broken had the unlinking actions
     been executed.

-uu   Update  regular files.   Copy the  source  only if  it was  created or
     altered more recently than the target  file, or if the target does not
     exist.

-vv   Print a  verbose account of its activities.   ccpp prints a file-by-file
     account of its actions, in  addition to the information listed under -
     tt.
