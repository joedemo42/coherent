llooookk -- Command

Find matching lines in a sorted file
llooookk [-ddff] _s_t_r_i_n_g [_f_i_l_e]

The command  llooookk scans the  sorted _f_i_l_e and  prints each line  that begins
with _s_t_r_i_n_g.

The following options specify the order of the search:

-dd Use dictionary  order: the only characters  tested are alphanumerics and
   blanks.

-ff Convert all alphabetic characters to upper case.

If no _f_i_l_e is specified, llooookk uses /uussrr/ddiicctt/wwoorrddss with the -ddff option.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
For an example of how to use this command, see the entry for ssppeellll.

_F_i_l_e_s
/uussrr/ddiicctt/wwoorrddss -- File of words (sorted with ssoorrtt -ddff).

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, ssoorrtt

_N_o_t_e_s
Because the file /uussrr/ddiicctt/wwoorrddss is quite large, you may not have installed
it or uncompressed it when you  installed your COHERENT system.  If this is
the case, llooookk will not work correctly.
