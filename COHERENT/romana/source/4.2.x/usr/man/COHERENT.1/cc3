cccc33 -- Definition

cccc33 is the output phase of COHERENT.  It writes a file of assembly language
rather than a relocatable object module.  This phase is optional; it allows
you to examine the code generated by the compiler.  To produce an assembly-
language output of  a C program, use the -SS  option on the cccc command line.
For example,

    cc -S foo.c

tells cccc to produce a file of assembly language called ffoooo.ss, instead of an
object module.
