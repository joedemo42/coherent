ccllrrii -- Command

Clear i-node
/eettcc/ccllrrii _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m _i_n_u_m_b_e_r ...

ccllrrii  zeroes out  each  i-node with  _i_n_u_m_b_e_r on  _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m. _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m  is
almost  always a  device-special file  that corresponds  to a  disk device,
e.g.,  /ddeevv/rraatt00aa  or  /ddeevv/rrssdd11cc. The  raw  device  should  be used.   For
example, the command

    /etc/clri /dev/rat0a 8250

clears i-node  8250 on the file  system on device /ddeevv/rraatt00aa,  which is the
first partition on your first AT hard disk.

The user must have read and write permission on the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m. If the file
that _i_n_u_m_b_e_r  identifies is open, then  ccllrrii probably will not  work as you
expect: the system  maintains in core memory a copy  of all active i-nodes,
and the  kernel will eventually write  this copy to disk,  thus undoing the
action  of ccllrrii.  To ensure  that this  does not  happen, unmount  the file
system before you running ccllrrii. If  the i-node is for the root file system,
reboot the system immediately after you run ccllrrii.
