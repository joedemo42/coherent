eevvaall -- Command

Evaluate arguments
eevvaall [_t_o_k_e_n ...]

The shell  normally evaluates each token of an  input line before executing
it.  During  evaluation, the shell  performs parameter, command,  and file-
name pattern substitution.  The shell does _n_o_t interpret special characters
after performing substitution.

eevvaall  is useful  when an  additional level of  evaluation is  required.  It
evaluates its arguments and treats the result as shell input.  For example,

    A='>file'
    echo a b c $A

simply prints the output

    a b c >file

because `>' has no special meaning after substitution, but

    A='>file'
    eval echo a b c $A

redirects the output

    a b c

to ffiillee. Similarly,

    A='$B'
    B='string'
    echo $A
    eval echo $A

prints

    $B
    string

In the first eecchhoo the shell performs substitution only once.

The shell executes eevvaall directly.
