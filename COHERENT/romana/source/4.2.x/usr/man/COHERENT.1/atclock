Read or set the AT realtime clock
/eettcc/AATTcclloocckk [_y_y[_m_m[_d_d[_h_h[_m_m[._s_s]]]]]]

AATTcclloocckk reads  or sets the  system realtime clock  in an IBM  PC-AT system.
With no argument,  it reads the realtime clock and  returns a string in the
format expected by the command ddaattee. With an argument, it sets the realtime
clock to the given date.

The system  startup files /eettcc/bbrrcc and /eettcc/rrcc  typically contain a command
of the form

    date -s `/etc/ATclock`

to reset  the time  properly when  the COHERENT system  starts up.   The AT
realtime  clock typically  contains the  current  local standard  time (not
adjusted for daylight savings time).
