gguunnzziipp -- Command

GNU utility to uncompress files
gguunnzziipp [ -ccffhhLLrrttvvVV ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

gguunnzziipp is the GNU command that  uncompresses each _f_i_l_e named on its command
line.

Whenever possible, gguunnzziipp replaces each _f_i_l_e  whose name ends with .zz or .ZZ
(and which begins with the  correct magic number) with an uncompressed file
without the original suffix.  gguunnzziipp also recognizes the special extensions
.ttggzz and .ttaazz as shorthands for .ttaarr.zz or .ttaarr.ZZ.

gguunnzziipp can currently decompress files created by the COHERENT commands ggzziipp
or ccoommpprreessss, or by the UNIX  commands zziipp or ppaacckk. It automatically detects
the  format  by  which the  file  is  compressed  and  applies the  correct
algorithm to uncompress it.

When uncompressing the formats used by ggzziipp and zziipp, gguunnzziipp checks a 32-bit
CRC.  For files compressed by ppaacckk, gguunnzziipp checks the uncompressed length.

The format  used by ccoommpprreessss was not designed  to allow consistency checks.
However, gguunnzziipp  can sometimes detect a  corrupted .ZZ file.  If  you get an
error  when uncompressing  a .ZZ  file, do  not assume that  the .ZZ  file is
correct simply  because the COHERENT command  uunnccoommpprreessss does not complain.
This generally  means that most implementations of  uunnccoommpprreessss do not check
their input, and happily generate garbage output.

gguunnzziipp recognizes the following command-line options:

-cc   Write output to standard output,  and do not change the original _f_i_l_e.
     If  the command  line names  more than  one _f_i_l_e,  ggzziipp writes  to the
     standard output  a sequence  of independently compressed  members.  To
     obtain  better compression, concatenate  the _f_i_l_es  before compressing
     them.

-ff   force compression or decompression, even if _f_i_l_e has multiple links or
     the corresponding file  already exists.  Without this option, and when
     not  running in  the  background, ggzziipp  prompts to  verify whether  it
     should overwrite an existing file.

-hh   Help: display a screenful of information on how to run this program.

-LL   Display the ggzziipp license.

-rr   Recurse: if  a _f_i_l_e is  a directory, compress or  uncompress all files
     within it.

-tt   Test: check the integrity of a compressed file.

-vv   Verbose: display the name and percentage reduction for each _f_i_l_e as it
     is compressed.

-VV   Display the version  of this command, and the options  by which it was
     compiled.

gguunnzziipp returns zero if all went well.  It returns one if an error occurred,
and it returns two if it had to issue a warning message.

gguunnzziipp can issue the following warning messages:

_f_i_l_e: nnoott iinn ggzziipp ffoorrmmaatt
     A _f_i_l_e named on the command line was not compressed.

     The compressed file has been  damaged.  If the data were compressed by
     the program ccoommpprreessss, they can be  recovered up to the point of damage
     by using the program zzccaatt to concatenate the file into another file.

     _f_i_l_e was compressed  by a program that could deal  with more bits than
     the decompress  code on this machine.  Recompress  the file with ggzziipp,
     which compresses better and uses less memory.

     _f_i_l_e has  the suffix .zz  or .ZZ; therefore,  gguunnzziipp assumes that  it is
     compressed already.

     Respond `y' if you want the output file to be replaced; `n' if not.

gguunnzziipp: ccoorrrruupptt iinnppuutt
     gguunnzziipp  detected a  SSIIGGSSEEGGVV violation,  which  usually means  that the
     input file has been corrupted.
