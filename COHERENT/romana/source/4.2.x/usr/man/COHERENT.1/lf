llff -- Command

List directory's contents in columnar format
llff [_f_i_l_e ...]

llff is  a link to  the command llss  -CCFF. It prints  _f_i_l_e  in columnar format,
like the  command llcc. llff, however, combines files  and directories into one
listing, with  directories being indicated  by a slash after  the file name
and executable being indicated by an asterisk.  If a _f_i_l_e is a directory, ll
lists its  contents.  If  no _f_i_l_e  is named, llff  lists the contents  of the
current directory by default.
