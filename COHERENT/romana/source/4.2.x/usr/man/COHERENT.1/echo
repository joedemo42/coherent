eecchhoo -- Command

Repeat/expand an argument
eecchhoo [-nn] [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]

eecchhoo prints  each _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t on the standard output,  placing a space between
each _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t. It appends a newline  to the end of the output unless the -nn
flag is present.

eecchhoo  recognizes  the  following  special  character sequences.   For  each
occurrence  of  the   sequence,  it  substitutes  the  corresponding  ASCII
character.

          \b        Backspace
          \c        Print line without a newline (like -nn option)
          \f        Formfeed
          \n        Newline
          \r        Carriage return
          \t        Tab
          \v        Vertical tab
          \\        Backslash
          \0_n_n_n     _n_n_n is octal value of character (sshh only)
          \_n_n_n      _n_n_n is the octal value of character (kksshh only)

For example, when you enter the command:

    echo 'Please enter your name: \007\c'

The shell rings the bell and prints

    Please enter your name:

on your  screen.  Note that the  \000077 sequence causes the  terminal bell to
sound, and  that since the  \cc sequence was  specified, the cursor  will be
left positioned after the colon.

Under the Korn shell, eecchhoo is an alias for its built-in command pprriinntt.

Please  note that  eecchhoo  converts characters  to  spaces.  If  you wish  to
preseve  tab characters  in an  echoed string, you  must enclose  it within
quotation marks.  For example, the command

    echo $RECORD

displays:

    7 5 175 875

whereas the command

    echo "$RECORD"

displays:

    7   5   175 875

This  is important  when  you use  eecchhoo  with programs  for  which the  tab
character is significant.
