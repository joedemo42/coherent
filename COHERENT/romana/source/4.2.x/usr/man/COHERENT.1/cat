ccaatt -- Command

Concatenate the contents of a file to the standard output
ccaatt [ -uu ][ _f_i_l_e ... ]

ccaatt copies each _f_i_l_e arguments to  the standard output.  A `-' tells ccaatt to
read the standard  input.  If no _f_i_l_e is specified,  ccaatt reads the standard
input.

The  -uu option  makes the  output unbuffered.   Otherwise, ccaatt  buffers the
output in units of the machine's disk block size (e.g., 512 bytes).

If you  redirect ccaatt's the output  to one of its input  files, it will loop
forever, reading from  the file the text that it  has just written into it:
in effect, ccaatt will chase its own tail endlessly.
