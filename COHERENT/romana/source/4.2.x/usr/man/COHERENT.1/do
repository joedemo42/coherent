ddoo -- C Keyword

Introduce a loop

ddoo is a  C control statement that introduces a  loop.  Unlike ffoorr and wwhhiillee
loops,  the condition  in a  ddoo loop  is evaluated  _a_f_t_e_r the  operation is
performed.  ddoo always works in tandem with wwhhiillee; for example

do {
    puts("Next entry? ");
    fflush(stdout);
} while(getchar() != EOF);

prints a prompt on the screen and waits for the user to reply.  The ddoo loop
is convenient in this instance because the prompt must appear at least once
on the screen before the user replies.
