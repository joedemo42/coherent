dduu -- Command

Summarize disk usage
dduu [-aa] [-ss] [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ...]

dduu prints the total number of  disk blocks used by each named _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y. If
no  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  is  specified, dduu  prints  the  disk  usage  of the  current
directory.

The -aa (all) option causes dduu  to print a line for every file and directory
in the substructure.  Normally it prints a line only for each directory.

The -ss (summary) option prints only the line for the top level directory.

dduu understands links; it adds a file with more than one link to it into the
total only once.

_N_o_t_e_s
dduu  does  not  count  file-system  overhead  such as  indirect  blocks,  so
occasionally a  directory does not  fit on a  file system which  appears to
contain enough room for it.
