ddoossccpp -- Command

Copy files to/from an MS-DOS file system
ddoossccpp [-aabbkkmmrrvv] _s_r_c _d_e_s_t

ddoossccpp copies  files between MS-DOS  and COHERENT file  systems.  The MS-DOS
file system can  reside either on a floppy disk,  or on an MS-DOS partition
of a hard disk.

_s_r_c names the file being copied  and the file system where it resides; _d_e_s_t
names the  file system and  directory into which  the file is  copied.  The
operating system that owns the _s_r_c  file is implied by the name of the file
system on which it resides.  An  MS-DOS file system must be named using the
device  that holds  it, such  as floppy-disk  drive /ddeevv/ffhhaa00  or hard-disk
partition /ddeevv/aatt00aa. You  can also build a file of  aliases so that you can
access the  drives as  aa, bb,  etc.  For details,  see the  section entitled
_C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_i_n_g _t_h_e _d_o_s _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s, below.

ddoossccpp converts a file's name from one operating system's conventions to the
other's.  An MS-DOS file argument may  be specified in lower or upper case,
using `/' as the  path-name separator.  When transferring files from MS-DOS
to COHERENT, ddoossccpp converts an MS-DOS  file name to a COHERENT file name in
lower  case only.   If  the MS-DOS  file  name contains  no extension,  the
COHERENT file name contains  no `.'.  When transferring files from COHERENT
to MS-DOS, ddoossccpp converts all alphabetic characters in a COHERENT file name
to upper  case; if a period  `.' appears at the beginning or  end of a file
name, ddoossccpp  converts it to `_'.   ddoossccpp truncates the portion  of the file
name to the left of the `.' to a maximum of eight characters and portion to
the right of the `.' to a maximum of three characters.

ddoossccpp recognizes the following options:

aa  Perform ASCII  newline conversion on  file transfer.  When  moving files
   from  COHERENT to  MS-DOS, this  option  converts each  COHERENT newline
   character `\n'  (ASCII LF) to  an MS-DOS end-of-line (ASCII  CR and LF).
   When moving  files from  MS-DOS to COHERENT,  it does the  opposite.  By
   default, ddoossccpp  performs ASCII  conversion on  files that have  an ASCII
   extention.  See SSeettuupp, below.

bb  Do not perform any newline conversion on file transfers.

kk  Keep: give  the copied  file the  same time stamp  as its  original.  By
   default, ddoossccpp gives copied files the current time.

mm  Same as aa, described above

rr  Same as bb, described above.

vv  Verbose.  Provide additional information about each action performed.

_C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_i_n_g _t_h_e _d_o_s _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s
The ddooss family commands  read the file /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss before they begin
to interpret arguments.  By modifying this file, you can establish defaults
that let COHERENT's ddooss commands resembles their counterparts under MS-DOS.
You can set up two classes of defaults: _d_e_v_i_c_e defaults and _f_i_l_e defaults.

A device default  lets you declare an alias for  a device that holds an MS-
DOS file system.  This device can  be a floppy-disk drive, a partition on a
hard disk, or an extended partition on a hard disk.  The alias must consist
of one or  two letters.  No letter can serve  as an alias for more than one
device.  For example, the following declaration:

    c=/dev/at0a

specifies that  the hard-disk partition accessed via  device /ddeevv/aatt00aa is a
``Primary MS-DOS'' partition, and that  its alias is cc.  Hereafter, the ddooss
commands will interpret cc as being equivalent to /ddeevv/aatt00aa.

The declaration

    d=/dev/at0b;1

specifies the first ``Extended MS-DOS'' partition on the partition accessed
via device  /ddeevv/aatt00bb. Bumping  the number  from 1 to  2 would  specify the
second extended MS-DOS partition within partition /ddeevv/aatt00bb, as in:

    e=/dev/at0b;2

Notice how the device names (c,  d, and e) can correspond to the same drive
names  as  under  MS-DOS, whether  or  not  they  are  primary or  extended
partitions.

File declarations, on the other hand,  simply declare that all files with a
given suffix are text files and should always have their newline characters
converted from  COHERENT to  MS-DOS format  (or vice versa).   For example,
placing the line

    .c

in /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss tells all of the ddooss commands that all files with the
suffix .cc are text files and should have their newline characters converted
by   default.    You   can   have   any   number  of   file   defaults   in
/eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
The first example copies all C  source files from floppy drive /ddeevv/ffvvaa11 to
correspondingly named  files in  the current COHERENT  directory, preserves
the time stamp, and performs newline conversion upon them:

    doscp -akv /dev/fva1:source/\*.c .

Note that you  must quote wildcard characters with a  backslash to keep the
shell from interpreting them.   Also note that /ddeevv/ffvvaa11 is a high-density,
3.5-inch  floppy disk  in floppy-disk  drive 1.  So,  if your  ddeeffaauulltt file
contained the entry

    b=/dev/fva1
    .c

you could also have typed:

    doscp -kv b:source/\*.c .

The next example  copies a file from an MS-DOS  partition on your hard disk
to a COHERENT file system.  Suppose  that C is the primary MS-DOS partition
on   your  first   hard   drive.   The   following   command  copies   file
CC:\AAUUTTOOEEXXEECC.BBAATT to /ttmmpp/aauuttooeexxeecc.bbaatt in your COHERENT partition:

    doscp /dev/at0a:autoexec.bat /tmp

If your /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt file contains the entry

    c=/dev/at0a

then you can also type:

    doscp c:autoexec.bat /tmp

For a discussion of the error message

    Probably not a DOS disk

see the  notes to  the Lexicon  entry for ddoossccpp.  ddoossccpp does not  check for
unusual characters  in a COHERENT file  name or for file  names that differ
from other file names only in case.

Beware of  using ddoossccpp to  create impossible files, e.g.,  ccoomm11. Such files
create  serious problems;  for example,  if  you try  to TTYYPPEE  or otherwise
perform MS-DOS operations on ccoomm11, you will attack the MS-DOS device driver
instead of the  file.  Be sure to rename all  such files when you copy them
from a COHERENT to an MS-DOS file system.

ddoossccpp  does  not  understand  compressed  MS-DOS  file systems  created  by
programs such as SSttaacckkeerr or MS-DOS  6.0 ddbbllssppaaccee. If you are running MS-DOS
with file  compression, you must copy files to  an uncompressed file system
(for example,  to an uncompressed  floppy disk or to  the uncompressed host
for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the ddoossccpp.
