ccddmmpp -- Command

Dump COFF files into a readable form
ccddmmpp [-aaddllrrss] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

ccddmmpp  dumps a  file in  COFF  format into  its most  readable format.   Its
default is  to dump all information;  but as this can  produce a very large
output file, ccddmmpp lets you  use the following switches to mix-and-match its
output:

-aa   Suppress auxiliary symbol entries.

-dd   Suppress data dumps

-ll   Suppress line numbers.

-rr   Suppress relocation entries.

-ss   Suppress symbol entries.

cccc and aass do not produce  line numbers and auxiliary-symbol entries, and lldd
does not preserve them.

ccddmmpp writes  its dump into  the ``vertical hexadecimal  format,'' like that
produced  by the  function xxdduummpp(). For  example, the  vertical hexadecimal
dump of the string ``hello world.\n'' is:

   0 hell o wo rld. .
     6666.6276.7662.0
     85CC.F07F.2C4E.A

The hexadecimal  value of `h'  is 0x68, which appears  vertically under the
`h'.   The dump  is broken  into  groups of  four bytes;  every unprintable
character appears as `.'.
