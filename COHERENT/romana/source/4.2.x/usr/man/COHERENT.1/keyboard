How COHERENT handles the console keyboard

COHERENT comes with four device drivers for the keyboard, as follows:

     kkbb             Non-configurable driver, no virtual consoles
     nnkkbb            Configurable driver, no virtual consoles
     vvttkkbb           Non-configurable driver, virtual consoles
     vvttnnkkbb          Configurable driver, virtual consoles

To change the  keyboard driver you are using, or  to modify the behavior of
the driver nnkkbb, log in as the superuser rroooott and type:

    cd /etc/conf
    console/mkdev

The  script  /eettcc/ccoonnff/ccoonnssoollee/mmkkddeevv  walks  you  through  the  process  of
configuring your  console: you can  switch keyboard drivers from  kkbb to nnkkbb
(or vice  versa), install or remove the  virtual-console driver, change the
number  of virtual  consoles you  use,  or change  the keyboard-translation
table you use by default.

Once you have configured the console, type the following command:

    bin/idmkcoh -o /_k_e_r_n_e_l__n_a_m_e

where _k_e_r_n_e_l__n_a_m_e  is the  what you  wish to name  the newly  built kernel.
This builds  a new kernel that incorporates the  changes you requested.  To
invoke these  changes, simply reboot  and invoke kernel  _k_e_r_n_e_l__n_a_m_e in the
usual manner.
