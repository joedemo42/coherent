ccuutt -- Command

Select portions of each line of its input
ccuutt -cc_l_i_s_t [_f_i_l_e ...]
ccuutt -ff_l_i_s_t [-ss] [-dd _c_h_a_r] [_f_i_l_e ...]

ccuutt  selects portions  of each  line of  its input and  writes them  to the
standard output.   _l_i_s_t specifies  the portions  to select.  ccuutt  reads its
input from _f_i_l_e, or the standard input by default.

_l_i_s_t is  a comma-separated set of numbers or  number ranges.  Number ranges
consist of  a number, a hyphen  (`-'), and a second  number, and select the
fields  or  columns  from  the  first  number  to  the  second,  inclusive.
Preceding  a number  or number  range  by a  hyphen selects  all fields  or
columns from one  to the first number.  Following a  number or number range
by a hyphen  selects all fields or columns from  the last number to the end
of  the line.   Numbers and  number  ranges may  be repeated,  overlap, and
appear in  any order.  It is  not an error to select a  field or column not
present in the input line.

ccuutt recognizes the following command-line options:

-cc_l_i_s_t
    _l_i_s_t specifies character positions.

-ff_l_i_s_t
    _l_i_s_t specifies  fields, delimited in the input  by one <ttaabb> character.
    Output fields are separated by one <ttaabb> character.

-dd _c_h_a_r
    Use _c_h_a_r as the field delimiter instead of the <ttaabb> character.

-ss  Suppress lines  with no field-delimiter  characters.  Unless specified,
    ccuutt passes through unmodified all lines with no delimiters.

ccuutt returns zero on success, one if an error occurred.
