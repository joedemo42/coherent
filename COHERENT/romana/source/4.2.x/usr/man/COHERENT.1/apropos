aapprrooppooss -- Command

Find manual pages on a given topic
aapprrooppooss _t_o_p_i_c [ _t_o_p_i_c ... ]

This  command  implements  a simplified  version  of  the Berkeley  command
aapprrooppooss. It prints every line in  the file mmaann.iinnddeexx that contains a _t_o_p_i_c.
In this way, you can find what manual pages are available on a given topic.
For example, the command

    apropos daemon

prints something like the following:

     daemon    Definition
     hpd       Spooler daemon for laser printer
     lpd       Spooler daemon for line printer
     lpshut    Turn off the printer daemon despooler

You can  also use aapprrooppooss to  nudge your memory when  you cannot recall the
name of a given command or library function.

aapprrooppooss  reads  its information  from  the index  files  kept in  directory
/uussrr/mmaann. It  assumes that every  file in that  directory that ends  in the
string  .iinnddeexx is  an index  file.  For  details on  index files  and their
format, see the Lexicon entry for mmaann.
