ddiirrss -- Command

Print the contents of the directory stack
ddiirrss

The COHERENT shell sshh maintains an internal ``directory stack'', which is a
stack of  names of directories.  You can manipulate  this stack should you,
for  any reason,  wish  to traverse  a  number of  directories quickly  and
efficiently.

The command ddiirrss prints the current contents of the directory stack.
