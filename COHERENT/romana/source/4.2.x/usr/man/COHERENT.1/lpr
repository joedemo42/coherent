llpprr -- Command

Spool a job for printing on the line printer
llpprr [-ccmmnnrr] [-bb _b_a_n_n_e_r] [_f_i_l_e ...]

The command llpprr  spools each _f_i_l_e for printing on  the line printer.  If no
_f_i_l_e  is named  on the  command  line, llpprr  spools what  it reads  from the
standard input.

llpprr recognizes the following options:

-BB     Suppress printing of a banner.

-bb _b_a_n_n_e_r
       Print _b_a_n_n_e_r on the  banner page.  The default  banner is the user's
       login name.

-cc     Copy each _f_i_l_e into  the spooling directory, instead  of reading the
       file from its  home directory.  This  option lets you  change a _f_i_l_e
       before it has finished printing.

-mm     Write a message on the user's terminal when printing completes.

-nn     Do not send a message (default).

-rr     Remove the files when they have been spooled.

The  command  llppsskkiipp  aborts or  restarts  printing  of  the  file that  is
currently being  printed.  The command  eeppssoonn converts the  output of nnrrooffff
into a form usable by Epson-compatible dot-matrix printers.

Beginning with  release 4.2, COHERENT  also includes the  llpp print spooler.
llpp  offers  a more  sophisticated  way to  manage  printers, especially  on
machines that support multiple printers of the same type.  For details, see
the Lexicon entries for pprriinntteerr and llpp.
