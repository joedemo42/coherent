ccooll -- Command

Remove reverse and half-line motions
ccooll [ -bbddffxx ][ -pp_n ]

The command ccooll reads the standard input and writes to the standard output.
It removes reverse  and half-line motions from the output  of nnrrooffff for the
benefit of output devices that  cannot perform them.  It maintains an image
of the page  in memory and performs these motions  virtually so they do not
appear on the output.

ccooll understands four escape sequences: <eesscc> 77 for reverse line feed, <eesscc>
88 for half reverse line feed, <eesscc> 99 for half forward line feed, and <eesscc>
BB for  a forward line  feed.  It removes  <eesscc> (ASCII 033)  from the input
stream if it is followed by any other character.

Eight  control characters  besides <eesscc> are  interpreted by  ccooll. Newline,
return, space,  backspace, and tab carry their usual  meaning.  VVTT (013) is
an alternate  form of reverse  line feed.  The  characters SSOO (017)  and SSII
(016) signal the start and end  of text in an alternate character set.  ccooll
remembers  the character  set for  each  character and  uses SSOO  and SSII  to
distinguish them  on the output.  ccooll removes  all other control characters
from the input stream.

ccooll recognizes the following options:

-bb  The  output  device  cannot backspace.   Only  the  last  of  a set  of
    characters destined for a given position will appear.

-dd  Double-space the  output.  This  doubles the  length of a  document but
    preserves relative vertical spacing.  The -ff option has precedence.

-ff  The  output device  can perform  half-forward  line feeds.   Full lines
    appear single  spaced with half  lines between them.  This  is the only
    situation in which half forward line  feeds appear in the output of ccooll
    -- reverse line motions never appear.

-xx  Suppress the default conversion of white space to tabs on output.

-pp _n
    Set the internal page buffer size to _n full lines (default, 128).

If neither -ff nor -dd is  chosen, ccooll moves non-empty half lines to the next
lower full line and pushes all later lines down one line.  This can distort
the appearance of the document.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
AASSCCIIII, ccoommmmaannddss, nnrrooffff

_N_o_t_e_s
Backing  up past  the  start of  a  document or  of the  page buffer  loses
characters.
