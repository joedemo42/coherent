eexxeeccvvppee() -- General Function (libc)

Execute a load module
eexxeeccvvpp(_f_i_l_e, _a_r_g_v, _e_n_v)
cchhaarr *_f_i_l_e, *_a_r_g_v[], *_e_n_v[];

The function eexxeeccvvppee() calls the COHERENT system call eexxeeccvvee() to execute a
program.   It specifies  arguments as  a  single, NULL-terminated  array of
parameters, called  _a_r_g_v. The argument  _e_n_v is the  address of an  array of
pointers to strings  that define _f_i_l_e's environment.  This allows eexxeeccvvppee()
to pass a new environment to the program being executed.

Unlike the related call eexxeeccvv(), eexxeeccvvppee()  searches for _f_i_l_e in all of the
directories named in the environmental variable PPAATTHH-- that is, the current
PPAATTHH, not the one contained within the environmented pointed to by _e_n_v.

eexxeeccvvpp() does not return if successful.   It returns -1 for errors, such as
_f_i_l_e being  nonexistent, not accessible  with execute permission,  having a
bad format, or too large to fit in memory.

eexxeeccvvppee() is not part of the  SVID specification.  Therefore, it may not be
present on non-COHERENT operating systems.
