cchhrreeqq -- Command

Change priority, lifetime, or printer for a job
cchhrreeqq [-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [-ll_l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e] [-pp_p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y] _j_o_b

The command cchhrreeqq lets you change  the printer, lifetime, and priority of a
_j_o_b,  which  identifies  a  print  job  spooled with  the  command  llpp.  It
recognizes the following options:

-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
        Move _j_o_b to the queue for _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.

-ll_l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e
        Change the lifetime of _j_o_b, where _l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e is one of TT (temporary),
        SS (short-term), or LL (long-term).  Temporary  lifetime means that a
        job ``survives'' in the  spool directory for two  hours after being
        spooled; short-term means that it survives  48 hours; and long-term
        that it survives for 72 hours.  After a job's lifetime has expired,
        the print daemon llppsscchheedd removes it.

-pp_p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
        Change the despooling priority of _j_o_b  to _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y, which is one of
        00 (highest  priority)  to  99  (lowest  priority).  Jobs  with  high
        priority are printed  before those with low  priority.  The default
        priority is 22.

_N_o_t_e_s
You  can  reset  the  default  priority  for  print  jobs  by  setting  the
environmental variable MMLLPP_PPRRIIOORRIITTYY.
