ccoommpprreessss -- Command

Compress a file
ccoommpprreessss [ -ddffvvcc ] [ -bb_n_u_m ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

ccoommpprreessss compresses a file using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm.  With text files
and archives, it often can achieve 50% rate of compression.

If one or more _f_i_l_es are specified on the command, ccoommpprreessss compresses them
and appends the suffix .ZZ onto  the end of each compressed file's name.  If
no _f_i_l_e is specified on the command line, ccoommpprreessss compresses text from the
standard input and writes the compressed text to the standard output.

ccoommpprreessss recognizes the following options:

-bb   The ``bits'' option.  ccoommpprreessss  uses the compression level set via the
     _n_u_m argument.   Previous releases of ccoommpprreessss  would only allow values
     of _n_u_m up to 12, with  12 being the default value if the -bb option was
     not  specified.   The version  of  ccoommpprreessss  introduced with  COHERENT
     version 3.1 handles values up to 16, with 12 being the default.

-cc   Send output to stdout.

-dd   Decompress rather than compress.

-ff   Force an  output file  to be  generated even if  no space is  saved by
     compression.

-vv   Verbose   mode:  force   ccoommpprreessss  to   write  statistics   about  its
     performance.

If you  wish to  ensure backwards  compatibility with previous  releases of
COHERENT, do not use ccoommpprreessss with a _n_u_m value greater than 12.
