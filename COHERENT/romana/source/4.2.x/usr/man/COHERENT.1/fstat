Find file attributes

ffssttaatt(_d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r, _s_t_a_t_p_t_r) iinntt _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r; ssttrruucctt ssttaatt *_s_t_a_t_p_t_r;

ffssttaatt() returns a structure that contains the attributes of a file or pipe,
including protection information,  file type, and file size.  _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r is
the file  descriptor for  the open  file or pipe,  and _s_t_a_t_p_t_r points  to a
structure of  type ssttaatt, which  is defined in  the header file  ssttaatt.hh. For
further information, see its entry in the Lexicon.

_D_i_a_g_n_o_s_t_i_c_s
ffssttaatt() returns -1 if the file is not found or if _s_t_a_t_p_t_r is invalid.

_N_o_t_e_s
ffssttaatt() differs  from the related function ssttaatt mainly  in that it accesses
the file through its descriptor, which was returned by a successful call to
ooppeenn(), whereas ssttaatt takes the file's  path name and opens it itself before
checking its status.
