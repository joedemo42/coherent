#lliinnee is  a preprocessing  directive that resets  the line number  within a
file.  The  ANSI Standard defines  the line number  as being the  number of
newline characters read, plus one.

#lliinnee can  take any of  three forms.  The  first, #lliinnee _n_u_m_b_e_r,  resets the
current line number in the source  file to _n_u_m_b_e_r. The second, #lliinnee _n_u_m_b_e_r
_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, resets the line number to _n_u_m_b_e_r and changes the name of the file
to  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The third,  #lliinnee  _m_a_c_r_o_s, contains  macros  that have  been
defined  by earlier  preprocessing directives.  When  the macros  have been
expanded by the preprocessor,  the #lliinnee instruction will then resemble one
of the first two forms and be interpreted appropriately.

_N_o_t_e_s
Most  often, #lliinnee  is used  to  ensure that  error messages  point to  the
correct line  in the  program's source code.   A program generator  may use
this directive  to associate errors  in generated C code  with the original
sources.  For  example, the program generator  yyaacccc uses #lliinnee instructions
to  link  the  C code  it  generates  with the  yyaacccc  code  written by  the
programmer.
