llxx -- Command

List directory's contents in columnar format
llxx [_f_i_l_e ...]

llxx is a link to the  command llss -xx. It prints each _f_i_l_e in columnar format,
like the  command llcc,  except that directories  and file names  are printed
together in one listing.  If a  _f_i_l_e is a directory, llxx lists its contents.
If no  _f_i_l_e is  named, llxx  lists the contents  of the current  directory by
default.
