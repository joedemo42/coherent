ccuu -- Command

UNIX-compatible communications utility
ccuu [ooppttiioonnss] [_s_y_s_t_e_m] [_p_h_o_n_e] [ddiirr]

The  command ccuu  implements a  version of  the communications  utility used
under UNIX System V.  (Its name  is an acronym for ``call UNIX''.) With it,
you  can  interactively telephone  other  systems,  upload files,  download
files, and perform other communications tasks.  Unlike the program cckkeerrmmiitt,
which is  also included  with COHERENT, ccuu  uses the information  stored in
UUCP  data-base files  ddiiaall, ppoorrtt,  and ssyyss  to automate  the dialing  of a
remote system.

To tell  ccuu to dial a  given system, just use that system's  name on the ccuu
command line.  ccuu then reads from files ddiiaall, ppoorrtt, and ssyyss the information
on how  to dial the  system you have  named; then uses  that information to
open the port, set up the modem, and dial the system, up to the point where
you see a  login prompt on the remote system.   For example, to dial system
mmwwccbbbbss, use the command:

    cu mwcbbs

Instead of  dialing a  remote system,  you may wish  to talk directly  to a
modem -- for example, to reset its registers; or you may wish to log into a
local system that  is directly connected to your system  via a serial port.
To talk directly to a device, use the option -pp followed by the name of the
port into which  the device is plugged, plus the  command ddiirr. This command
tells ccuu that  you wish to talk to the  port directly.  (Ports are named in
the file ppoorrtt; for details, see  its entry in the Lexicon.) For example, to
talk directly a modem that is on a port named MMWWCCBBBBSS, use the command:

    cu -p MWCBBS dir

To have ccuu dial a specific telephone number over a specific port, again use
the option -pp option to name  the port, followed by the telephone number to
call.  For example, the command

    cu -p MWCBBS 17085590412

connects to the  modem on port MMWWCCBBBBSS and dial  the telephone number 1-708-
559-0412.

ccuu assumes that  a string that begins with an  alphabetic character names a
system.  To call a system whose  name begins with numeral, use the command-
line option -zz, described below.

_c_u _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s
You can  give commands  to ccuu  while you converse  with the  remote system.
Each command begins with an escape character, which by default is the tilde
`~'.   ccuu recognizes  the  escape character  only  when it  appears at  the
beginning of a line.  After you  type the escape character, ccuu replies with
the name of your system, to  show that it is ready to receive your command.
If you  do not see  ccuu's reply within  a second or two,  something has gone
wrong.

To send  to the  remote system  an escape character  at the beginning  of a
line, enter it twice; for example, typing

    ~~

sends a single `~' to the  remote system.  All commands are either a single
character or a word that begins with `%'.

ccuu recognizes the following commands:

~.   Terminate the conversation.

~! _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     Run _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in a shell on  your local system.  If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is given,
     start up a shell.

~$ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     Run _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  on your local  system, and redirect to  the remote system
     what _c_o_m_m_a_n_d writes to the standard output.

~| _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     Run  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d on  your local  system,  and pipe  into _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  what the
     remote system sends to your system.

~+ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     Combine the commands ~$ and ~|.

~#
~%bbrreeaakk
     Send a break signal.

~cc _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
~%ccdd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     ccdd to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y on your local system.

~> _f_i_l_e
     Send _f_i_l_e to the remote system.  This command just dumps the file over
     the communication  line, and performs  no error checking.   It assumes
     that the remote system is expecting  it.  You should first open a file
     on the remote system such as through the command

         cat > filename

     before you invoke this feature of ccuu.

~<   Receive a  file from the  remote system.  ccuu  prompts you to  name the
     file into which it will write what it receives from the remote system,
     then prompts  you for the command  to execute on the  remote system to
     begin the  file transfer  (often, just  ccaatt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e).  ccuu  reads data
     from the remote system and writes them into into the file you named on
     your system until it detects the variable eeooffrreeaadd.

~pp _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e _f_a_r_f_i_l_e
~%ppuutt _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e _f_a_r_f_i_l_e
     Copy (or _p_u_t) file  _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e on your  system into file  _f_a_r_f_i_l_e on the
     remote system.

~tt _f_a_r_f_i_l_e _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e
~%ttaakkee _f_a_r_f_i_l_e _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e
     Take  file _f_a_r_f_i_l_e  from the  remote  system, and  write it  into file
     _h_e_r_e_f_i_l_e on  your system.  This  runs the appropriate  commands on the
     remote system.

~ss _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e [_v_a_l_u_e]
     Set the ccuu  _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to _v_a_l_u_e. If no value  is not given, set _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
     to ttrruuee. ccuu's variables are described below.

~! _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
     Set the ccuu _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to ffaallssee. ccuu's variables are described below.

~%nnoossttoopp
     Turn off XXOONN/XXOOFFFF flow control.

~%ssttoopp
     Turn on XXOONN/XXOOFFFF flow control.

_c_u _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s
The following variables are build into ccuu to control its default behaviors:

eessccaappee  The escape character.  By default, this is the tilde `~'.

ddeellaayy   If this  variable  is  true,  ccuu delays  for  one  second after  it
        recognizes the escape character.  The default is true.

eeooll     This variable gives the characters that ccuu recognizes as completing
        a line of input.   ccuu recognizes the escape  character only when it
        occurs immediately _a_f_t_e_r one of the  eeooll characters.  ccuu recognizes
        the following eeooll characters by default: <ccttrrll-CC>, <ccttrrll-DD>, <ccttrrll-
        OO>, <ccttrrll-QQ>, <ccttrrll-RR>, <ccttrrll-SS>, and <ccttrrll-UU>.

bbiinnaarryy  This  variable  indicates   whether  to  pass   binary  information
        untouched when it transfers a file.   If this variable is false, ccuu
        converts newline characters  to carriage returns.  If  set to true,
        then ccuu  passes  binary  data through  untouched.   The default  is
        ffaallssee.

bbiinnaarryy-pprreeffiixx
        This variable gives the string that  prefaces a binary character in
        a file transfer.  This variable applies only if the variable bbiinnaarryy
        variable is true.  The default is <ccttrrll-ZZ>.

eecchhoo-cchheecckk
        If ttrruuee,  ccuu checks  file transfers  by  examining what  the remote
        system echoes.   This  is  not  a  robust  method of  checking  the
        integrity of a transferred file, but it is the best that ccuu offers.
        The default is ffaallssee.

eecchhoonnll  This defines the  character that ccuu  looks for after  it sends each
        line in a file.  The default is the carriage return.

ttiimmeeoouutt
        This variable  sets  the time,  in  seconds, that  ccuu  waits for  a
        character either when  it does echo-checking  or when it  looks for
        the eecchhoonnll character.  The default is 3300.

kkiillll    This tells ccuu  the character to use  to delete a line  if the echo-
        check fails.  The default is <ccttrrll-UU>.

rreesseenndd  This sets the  number of times  to resend a line  if the echo-check
        continues to fail.  The default is ten.

eeooffwwrriittee
        This sets the string that ccuu writes  after it sends a file with the
        command ~>. The default is <ccttrrll-DD>.

eeooffrreeaadd
        This sets the  string that  ccuu looks for  after it receives  a file
        retrieved with the command ~<. The  default is $, which is intended
        to be a typical shell prompt.

vveerrbboossee
        This tells  ccuu whether  to print  accumulated information  during a
        file transfer.  The default is ttrruuee.

To  list the  values of  the variables,  use the command  ~vv.  To  modify a
variable, use  the commands ~ss  or ~!.  For  example, to turn  off the one-
second pause after sending an escape character, use the command:

    ~! delay

To change the escape character from `~' to `\', use the command:

    ~s escape \

_O_p_t_i_o_n_s
ccuu recognizes the following command-line options:

-ee      Use even parity.

-oo      Use odd parity.  If you use both -ee  and -oo on the command line, no
        parity is  used.   If neither  is  specified, ccuu  uses the  default
        parity of the line.

-tt      Map every carriage return character  to the pair carriage/linefeed.
        Use this option when transferring files to an MS-DOS system.

-hh      Half-duplex mode: echo  locally all  characters sent to  the remote
        system.

-zz _s_y_s_t_e_m
        This names the  system to  call.  You must  use this option  if the
        name of the remote system begins with a numeral.

-cc _n_u_m_b_e_r
        This names the telephone number to  call.  You must use this option
        if the telephone number begins with a letter.

-pp _p_o_r_t
        This names the port to use.  If you do not use this option, ccuu uses
        the default port  for the  system being contacted,  as set  in file
        /uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/ssyyss.

-aa _p_o_r_t
        This is the same as the option -pp.

-ll _d_e_v_i_c_e
        This option names the device on which to dial out.  Use this option
        to dial out on ports  that are not list in the  file ppoorrtt. You must
        have write permission on _d_e_v_i_c_e.

-ss _s_p_e_e_d
        The speed (baud rate) to use.

-#      Where # is a number, equivalent to -ss #.

-nn      Prompt for the telephone number to use.

-dd      Enter debugging mode.  This is equivalent to -xx aallll.

-xx _a_c_t_i_v_i_t_y
        Log a given _a_c_t_i_v_i_t_y.  These logs can help  you debug problems with
        ccuu.  ccuu recognizes the following activities:

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
cckkeerrmmiitt, ccoommmmaannddss, ddiiaall, ppoorrtt, ssyyss, UUUUCCPP

_N_o_t_e_s
Unlike cckkeerrmmiitt, the file-transfer  facility in ccuu is primitive and performs
no error  checking.  If  you wish primarily  to transfer files,  you should
consider using cckkeerrmmiitt instead of ccuu.

ccuu requires that the device  /ddeevv/ccoonnssoollee appear last in file /eettcc/ttttyyss. If
this is  not so, ccuu refuses  to disable the enabled port  or dial out.  For
details on this file, see the Lexicon entry for ttttyyss.

ccuu was  ported to  COHERENT from  the Taylor UUCP  package, written  by Ian
Taylor (ian@airs.com).
