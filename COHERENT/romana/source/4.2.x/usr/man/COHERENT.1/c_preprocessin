Hal,

May  I  ask  one more  question.   Let's  suppose,  just  for the  sake  of
discussion, that the installation  had worked correctly.  When would I have
seen the queries about the  keyboard and about the virtual consoles?  Would
it have  come right  after the  introduction?  Or would  it have  come just
before or after the point where I was interrogated about serial ports?

Sorry to be  a pest, but if I have that  one bit of information, I can ship
the release notes out the door.

Thanks.
