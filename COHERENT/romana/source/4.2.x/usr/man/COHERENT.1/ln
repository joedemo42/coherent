llnn -- Command

Create a link to a file
llnn [-ff] _o_l_d_f_i_l_e _n_e_w_f_i_l_e
llnn [-ff] _o_l_d_f_i_l_e ... _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

The COHERENT system  knows a file by its i-node  number.  Each file is also
_l_i_n_k_e_d to  one or more file  names, each name being  stored in a directory.
This system  means that  the same  file can be  known by multiple  names in
multiple directories.  The command llnn lets you create a new link to a file.

In its  first form, llnn links  the name _n_e_w_f_i_l_e to the  file that is already
named _o_l_d_f_i_l_e, provided that _n_e_w_f_i_l_e does not already exist.

In the  second form,  llnn links  _o_l_d_f_i_l_e with an  identical name  in another
_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y. In effect, one file will ``live'' in two directories.

If _n_e_w_f_i_l_e already exists, -ff forces llnn to unlink it and assign its name to
_o_l_d_f_i_l_e.

Links to  directories or across file systems  are impossible.  For example,
if your  COHERENT system has  two file systems,  one mounted on  /ff and the
other mounted  on /uussrr, you cannot  use llnn to link  a file in /vv  to one in
/uussrr.
