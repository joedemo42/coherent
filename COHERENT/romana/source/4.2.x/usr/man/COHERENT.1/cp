ccpp -- Command

Copy a file
ccpp [ -dd ]  _o_l_d_n_a_m_e _n_e_w_n_a_m_e
ccpp [ -dd ]  _f_i_l_e_1 ... _f_i_l_e_N _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

ccpp copies files.   In its first form, ccpp copies  the contents of _o_l_d_n_a_m_e to
_n_e_w_n_a_m_e,  which it  creates if  necessary.  If _n_e_w_n_a_m_e  is a  directory, ccpp
copies _o_l_d_n_a_m_e to a file of the same name in directory _n_e_w_f_i_l_e.

In its  second form, ccpp  copies each _f_i_l_e,  from _f_i_l_e_1 through  _f_i_l_e_N, into
_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

With the -dd option, ccpp preserves the date (modification time) of the source
file or  files on the target  file or files.  By  default, target files get
the current time.

A file cannot be copied to itself.

_N_o_t_e_s
If you use ccpp to copy  a file into another, existing file, the newly copied
file takes on  the permissions of the file into  which the text was copied.
For  example, consider  the files  ffoooo  and bbaarr,  whose permissions  are as
follows:

    -rw-r--r--  1 fred       user            40 Tue Apr 14 18:19 bar
    -rw-r-----  1 fred       user          1816 Tue Apr 14 20:53 foo

If you use ccpp to copy ffoooo into bbaarr, then typing llss -ll shows the following:

    -rw-r--r--  1 fred       user          1816 Tue Apr 14 21:37 bar
    -rw-r-----  1 fred       user          1816 Tue Apr 14 20:53 foo

bbaarr now  has exactly the  same contents as  ffoooo but retains its  old set of
permissions.
