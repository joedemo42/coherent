aaccccttoonn -- Command

Enable/disable process accounting
/eettcc/aaccccttoonn [ _f_i_l_e ]

One  of  the accounting  mechanisms  available on  the  COHERENT system  is
_p_r_o_c_e_s_s  _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g,  also  called  _s_h_e_l_l  _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g.  Process  accounting
records each process, who initiates it, and how long it takes to execute.

By  issuing the  command aaccccttoonn  with a _f_i_l_e  argument, you  enable process
accounting.  The  system then writes  raw accounting data  into _f_i_l_e, which
normally should  be /uussrr/aaddmm/aacccctt. The command  ssaa summarizes the resulting
raw  statistics.   If  issued with  no  argument,  aaccccttoonn disables  process
accounting.

aaccccttoonn is normally invoked by the initialization command file /eettcc/rrcc.

As the  file /uussrr/aaddmm/aacccctt  can become very  large, special care  should be
taken if  process accounting is enabled  on a COHERENT system  with a small
disk file system.
