aarreennaa -- Definition

An aarreennaa is the area of  memory that is available for a program to allocate
dynamically  at run  time.  It  is divided  into _a_l_l_o_c_a_t_e_d  and _u_n_a_l_l_o_c_a_t_e_d
blocks.  The unallocated blocks together form the ``free memory pool''.

Portions of the arena can  be allocated using the functions mmaalllloocc, ccaalllloocc,
or rreeaalllloocc; returned  to the free memory pool with  ffrreeee; or checked to see
if they  are allocated or not  with nnoottmmeemm. To check  whether the arena has
been corrupted or not, use the function mmeemmookk.
