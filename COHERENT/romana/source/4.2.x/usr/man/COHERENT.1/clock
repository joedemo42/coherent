cclloocckk -- Device Driver

Read the system clock
/ddeevv/cclloocckk

The file  /ddeevv/cclloocckk lets you  read and set  your system's clock.   It is a
part of the  driver mmeemm, which manages memory; thus,  it has major number 0
and minor number 5.

The  real  time  clock occupies  the  first  14  bytes  of nonvolatile  RAM
(/ddeevv/ccmmooss).  The  difference between /ddeevv/ccmmooss and  /ddeevv/cclloocckk is that the
latter device locks  the circuit during a read, so  that the clock will not
be updated as it is being read.

/ddeevv/cclloocckk limits access to a 14-byte data area.  Attempts to read or write
beyond this limit will fail.   /ddeevv/cclloocckk stores the system time in binary-
coded decimal (BCD).  For details on BCD, see the Lexicon entry for ffllooaatt.

The COHERENT command AATTcclloocckk reads this device and writes to it.
