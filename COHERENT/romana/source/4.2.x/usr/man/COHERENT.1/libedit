lliibbeeddiitt -- Library

Routines to gather and edit user input
/uussrr/lliibb/lliibbeeddiitt.aa

lliibbeeddiitt.aa  is  a library  of  routines  that implement  a  simple tool  for
entering and editing lines of data.   The includes two routines that can be
called from a user-level program:

rreeaaddlliinnee()
     Read a  line of input from  the standard input, and  let the user edit
     it.

aadddd_hhiissttoorryy()
     Add a line of edited input  into a history buffer, from which the user
     can retrieve it for further editing and use.

Each is described in its own Lexicon entry.

These routines implement  a simple, EMACS-like line-editing interface, much
like the one available under the Korn shell kksshh.  To include these routines
in an application, just call them  as you would any other library function,
and link the library lliibbeeddiitt.aa into the executable.
