lliinneess  is an  interactive COHERENT  version of a  two-player board  game by
Claude Soucie  called _L_i_n_e_s _o_f _A_c_t_i_o_n.  The screen  displays the game board
with ``X''  and ``O'' characters  marking the positions of  the pieces.  To
see the rules  of the game, type ``r'' and  then press <EEnntteerr>.  To see the
available interactive commands, type ``h'' and press <EEnntteerr>.

Two players  can use lliinneess to  keep track of a game  between them by moving
with the  ``M'' command.   Alternatively, one  player can play  against the
computer by moving with the  ``m'' command.  The program uses a tree-search
technique to consider possible moves; the  player can vary the speed of the
program's  replies with  commands  that change  the tree  search width  and
depth.
