ccdd -- Command

Change directory
ccdd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

The  shell keeps  track of  the directory  in which  the user  is currently
working.  If a  command is not specified by a  complete path name beginning
with  `/', the  shell prefixes  it  with the  name of  the current  working
directory.  ccdd  changes the current  working directory to  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y. If no
_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  is specified,  the directory  named  in the  $HHOOMMEE environmental
variable becomes the current working directory.
