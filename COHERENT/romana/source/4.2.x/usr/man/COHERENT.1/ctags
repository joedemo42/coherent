ccttaaggss -- Command

Generate tags and refs files for vi editor
ccttaaggss [-rr] _f_i_l_e_s...

ccttaaggss generates  the files ttaaggss  and rreeffss from  a group of  C-source files.
ttaaggss is used  by the eellvviiss editor's :ttaagg command,  <ccttrrll-]> command, and -tt
option.  rreeffss is used by the command rreeff.

Each C-source  file is scanned  for #ddeeffiinnee statements  and global function
definitions.  The name of the macro  or function becomes the name of a tag.
For each tag, a line is added to ttaaggss, which contains the following:

    -> the name of the tag
    -> a tab character
    -> the name of the file containing the tag
    -> a tab character
    -> a way to find the particular line within the file

rreeffss  is used  by  the command  rreeff,  which can  be invoked  via eellvviiss's  KK
command.   When ccttaaggss  finds a  global function  definition, it  copies the
function  header into  rreeffss.  The first  line  is flush  against the  right
margin, but  the argument  definitions are  indented.  The command  rreeff can
search rreeffss much faster than it could search all C-source files.  The file-
names list  will typically include the  names of all C-source  files in the
current directory, in the following format:

    ctags -r *.[ch]

The -rr  to ccttaaggss tells  it to generate  both ttaaggss and rreeffss.  Without -rr, it
generates only ttaaggss.

This version  of ccttaaggss does not  parse ANSI source code  very well.  It has
trouble recognizing the ANSI function definitions.
