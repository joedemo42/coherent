hhppdd -- System Administration

Spooler daemon for laser printer
/uussrr/lliibb/hhppdd

hhppdd is  the daemon that prints  jobs spooled by the  command hhpprr.  All jobs
are printed  on the  printer that is  accessed through device  /ddeevv/hhpp. For
information on  this device, and on printer management  in general, see the
Lexicon entry pprriinntteerr.

The command hhpprr invokes hhppdd automatically.   If there is no printing to do,
or if  another daemon is already  running (as indicated by  the file ddppiidd),
hhppdd  exits immediately.   Otherwise, it  searches  the spool  directory for
control files of  listings to print.  A control file  contains the names of
files to print,  the user name, banner pages, and  files to be removed upon
completion.

hhppdd  does  not  print  listings  in  any particular  order.   There  is  no
prioritization of printing, either by size or by requester.

The command  hhppsskkiipp aborts or restarts printing of  the job currently being
printed by hhppdd.
