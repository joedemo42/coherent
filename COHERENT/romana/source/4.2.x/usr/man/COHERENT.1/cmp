ccmmpp -- Command

Compare bytes of two files
ccmmpp [-llss] _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 [_s_k_i_p_1 _s_k_i_p_2]

The command  ccmmpp compares two files  byte by byte for  equality.  _f_i_l_e_1 and
_f_i_l_e_2 name the  files to compare; the file name  `-' indicates the standard
input.

If ccmmpp  finds two bytes  that differ, it  prints the number of  the byte at
which the discrepancy occurs, then exits.  If it encounters EOF on one file
but not on the other, it prints the message:

    EOF on file_n

ccmmpp recognizes the following command-line options:

-ll Note each  differing byte by printing the positions  and octal values of
   the bytes of each file.

-ss Print nothing, but return the exit status.

By default,  ccmmpp begins  at byte  1 of each  file.  The  optional arguments
_s_k_i_p_1 and  _s_k_i_p_2 are integer values  that tell ccmmpp to  skip that many bytes
for the  corresponding file before it begins  the comparison.  For example,
the command

    cmp FOO BAR 35 40

tells ccmmpp to  skip the first 35 bytes of FFOOOO  and the first 40 bytes of BBAARR
before it begins to compare them.

ccmmdd returns zero for identical  files, one for non-identical files, and two
for errors, e.g., bad command or inaccessible file.
