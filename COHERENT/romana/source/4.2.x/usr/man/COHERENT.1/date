ddaattee -- Command

Print/set the date and time
ddaattee [-ss] [-uu] [[_y_y_m_m_d_d]_h_h_m_m[._s_s]]

ddaattee prints the time of day  and the current date, including the time zone.
If an argument is given, the  system's current time and date is changed, as
follows:

    _y_y    Year (00-99)
    _m_m    Month (01-12)
    _d_d    Day (01-31)
    _h_h    Hour (00-23)
    _m_m    Minute (00-59)
    _s_s    Seconds (00-59)

The seconds field is optional.  For example, typing

    date 860512141233

sets the  date to May 12,  1986, and the time to 2:12:33  P.M.  At least _h_h
and _m_m must be specified -- the rest are optional.

The date may be changed only by the superuser.

If option -ss is specified, ddaattee suppresses daylight savings time conversion
when setting the time.

If option -uu is specified, dates are set and printed in Greenwich Mean Time
(GMT) rather than in local time.

The  library   time  conversion  routines   used  by  ddaattee   look  for  the
environmental  variable  TTIIMMEEZZOONNEE,  which  specifies  local time  zone  and
daylight saving time information in the format described in ccttiimmee().

_N_o_t_e_s
Note that  the COHERENT version of  the ddaattee command differs  from the UNIX
version  in that  the last  two  fields of  its output  are reversed.   For
example, the UNIX output of ddaattee reads

    Sun Jan 13 12:02:09 CST 1991

where the COHERENT output reads:

    Sun Jan 13 12:02:09 1991 CST

This may be important when importing UNIX shell commands into COHERENT.
