aarrggcc -- C Language

Argument passed to main()
iinntt aarrggcc;

aarrggcc is an abbreviation for ``argument count''.  It is the traditional name
for the  first argument to a  C program's mmaaiinn routine.   By convention, it
holds  the number  of arguments  that are  passed to  mmaaiinn in  the argument
vector aarrggvv. Because  aarrggvv[00] is always the name of  the command, the value
of _a_r_g_c  is always  one greater than  the number of  command-line arguments
that the user enters.
