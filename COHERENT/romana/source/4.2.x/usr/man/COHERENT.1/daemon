ddaaeemmoonn -- Definition

A _d_a_e_m_o_n  is a program  that runs continually  on your computer.   It waits
quietly  for some  condition to  occur; then it  awakens and  performs some
action (such as redirecting the file to a printer).

For  example, the  daemon /eettcc/ccrroonn  wakes up every  minute and  checks all
ccrroonnttaabb files.  If  a file contains a command to  be executed at this time,
then ccrroonn executes it.

As a general rule, anything that  does not interact directly with users can
be classified as  a daemon.  Daemons do not generally  generate output to a
user's terminal.

Any time you have a resource,  like a printer or data base, to which access
should be controlled, you can use a daemon.

For a list of daemons available  under the COHERENT system, see the Lexicon
entry for AAddmmiinniisstteerriinngg CCOOHHEERREENNTT.

The function  bbeeddaaeemmoonn(), which is  included in lliibbmmiisscc, makes  a program a
daemon.  See the article on lliibbmmiisscc for details.

A daemon  may be killed accidentally, or through  an error condition.  When
that occurs, a user may summon  the daemon from the misty deep, but it will
not come.  The superuser rroooott can reinvoke a daemon like any other program.
