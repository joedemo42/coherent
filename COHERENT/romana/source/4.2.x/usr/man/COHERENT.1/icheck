iicchheecckk -- Command

i-node consistency check
iicchheecckk [-ss] [-bb _N ...] [ -vv ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...

Each block in a file system must be either free (i.e., in the free list) or
allocated (i.e., associated with exactly one i-node).  iicchheecckk examines each
specified _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m, printing block  numbers that are claimed by more than
one i-node, or claimed by both an i-node and the free list.  It also checks
for blocks that appear more than  once in the block list of an i-node or in
the free list.

The option -vv (verbose) causes iicchheecckk  to print a summary of block usage in
the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.  The option -ss  causes iicchheecckk to  ignore the free  list, to
note which blocks are claimed by i-nodes, and to rebuild the free list with
the remainder.  A list of block  numbers may be submitted with the -bb flag;
iicchheecckk prints  the data  structure associated with  each block as  the file
system is scanned.

The raw  device should be used,  and the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m should  be unmounted if
possible.  If this is not possible  (e.g., on the root file system) and the
-ss option is  used, the system must be rebooted  immediately to expunge the
obsolete superblock.

The exit status bits for a bad return are as follows:

00xx0011 Miscellaneous error (e.g. out of space)
00xx0022 Too hard to fix without human intervention
00xx0044 Bad free block
00xx0088 Missing blocks
00xx1100 Duplicates in free list
00xx2200 Bad block in free list

The message  ``dups in free''  indicates a block  is in the  free list more
than once.   ``bad freelist'' indicates  the presence of bad  blocks on the
free list.  A ``bad'' block is one that lies outside the bounds of the file
system.  A ``dup'' (duplicated) block  is one associated with the free list
and an i-node, or with more  than one i-node.  All the errors above _m_u_s_t be
corrected before the file system is mounted.  ``bad ifree'' means allocated
i-nodes are on the free i-node list; this is inconsequential.

This command has largely been replaced by ffsscckk.
