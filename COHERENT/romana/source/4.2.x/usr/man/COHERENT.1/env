EENNVV -- Environmental Variable

File read to set environment

Whenever the  Korn shell is  invoked, it executes  the script named  in the
environmental  variable EENNVV.  By  custom, this  is  set to  ${HHOOMMEE}/.kksshhrrcc,
although you can name any file  you wish.  This script usually sets aliases
and environmental  variables, and  executes the  sseett command to  modify the
behavior of the shell itself.

By defining EENNVV in your .pprrooffiillee, you can ensure that this file is executed
whenever you invoke a shell.  If you wish to have its definitions read only
by the login shell, insert the instruction

    unset ENV

at the end of the script named by EENNVV.
