cc -- Command

Print multi-column output
cc [ -ll_N ] [ -ww_N ] [ -001122 ]

cc reads  lines from the  standard input and  writes them in  columns on the
standard  output.   The  longest input  line  and  the  width  of the  page
determine how many columns will fit across the page.

cc recognizes the following options:

-ll_N  Set the  length of the  page to _N  lines.  cc columnizes  its output by
     pages when this option is used with mode 1 or mode 2.

-ww_N  Set the width of the page to _N characters.  The default is 80.

-00   Multi-column mode 0.  Order the fields horizontally across the page.

-11   Multi-column mode 1  (default mode).  Order the fields vertically down
     each column; the last column may be short.

-22   Multi-column mode 2.  Order the  fields similarly to mode 1, but place
     blank fields in the last output line rather than the last column.

Options may  also be  given in the  environmental variable CC,  separated by
white  space.  Command  line options override  options in  the environment.
For example,

    export C="-l56 -w72 -2"
    c -w80 <file1

has the same effect as

    c -l56 -w72 -2 -w80 <file1

This command sets the page width to 80 rather than to 72.

cc prints ``out  of memory'' and returns an exit  status of one if it cannot
allocate enough memory to process its input.
