/eettcc/bbaaddssccaann [ -vv ] [ -oo _p_r_o_t_o ] [ -bb _b_o_o_t ] _d_e_v_i_c_e _x_d_e_v_i_c_e

bbaaddssccaann scans a floppy disk or a partition of the hard disk for bad blocks.
It writes  onto the  standard output  a prototype file  that lists  all bad
blocks on the disk.

bbaaddssccaann recognizes the following options:

-vv      Print an estimate of time needed to finish examining the device.

-oo _p_r_o_t_o
        Redirect output into file _p_r_o_t_o.

-bb _b_o_o_t Insert  a given  _b_o_o_t into  the proto file  as the  bootstrap.  The
        default is /ccoonnff/bboooott.

_d_e_v_i_c_e names the special device to scan.

The command  line for bbaaddssccaann  comes in two  forms, as shown at  the top of
this article.  The first version is  for a floppy disk; _s_i_z_e gives the size
of the device, in blocks.  The second version is for a hard-disk partition;
_x_d_e_v_i_c_e specifies devices /ddeevv/aatt00xx or /ddeevv/aatt11xx, which hold the partition-
table information  for the disk  in question.  bbaaddssccaann reads  the data from
the boot block of the drive to find the size of the ddeevviiccee.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
The first  example uses bbaaddssccaann to  find all bad blocks  on a high-density,
3.5-inch floppy disk in drive 1 (i.e., drive B), and writes its output into
file pprroottoo:

    /etc/badscan -v -o proto /dev/rfva1 2880

See the  article ffllooppppyy ddiisskkss  for a table  that gives the  device name and
number of  sectors to  be found  on the various  types of floppy  disk that
COHERENT recognizes.

The  second example  uses  bbaaddssccaann to  prepare  a list  of  bad blocks  for
partition 2 on hard-drive 0, which  is an IDE drive accessed via COHERENT's
aatt driver.  Again, the output is written into file pprroottoo:

    /etc/badscan -v -o /conf/proto.at0c /dev/rat0c /dev/at0x

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
aatt, bbaadd, ccoommmmaannddss, ffllooppppyy ddiisskkss, mmkkffss

_N_o_t_e_s
Because SCSI hard-disk drives maintain their own map of bad blocks, bbaaddssccaann
is not required for SCSI drives.   However, we recommend that you use it on
removeable-media SCSI drives.
