ddeettaabb -- Command

Replace tab characters with spaces
ddeettaabb [_t_a_b_s_i_z_e]

The command  ddeettaabb reads the  standard input, replaces  every tab character
with spaces, and writes the result to the standard output.

ddeettaabb  assumes that  a tab  stop  occurs every  _t_a_b_s_i_z_e, which  must be  an
integer  greater than  one  and less  than  257.  If  you do  not supply  a
_t_a_b_s_i_z_e, ddeettaabb assumes that a  tab stop occurs every eight characters.  You
can  also  override  the default  tab  size  by  setting the  environmental
variable TTAABBSSIIZZEE to a value other than eight.
