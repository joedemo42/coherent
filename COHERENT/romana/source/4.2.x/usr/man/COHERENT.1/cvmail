ccvvmmaaiill [-mm _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]

The  command  ccvvmmaaiill converts  to  System V  format  existing COHERENT  3.X
mailboxes and  files used  to store messages  saved by COHERENT's  3.X mail
utility.

To   convert   a   default   mailbox   (i.e.,   a  mailbox   in   directory
/uussrr/ssppooooll/mmaaiill), invoke ccvvmmaaiill with its -mm option, followed by the name of
the user  whose mailbox is  to be converted.   For example, to  convert the
mailbox belonging to user bboobb, type:

    cvmail -m bob

If you have saved mail messages into a file, invoke ccvvmmaaiill with the name of
the file to convert.  For example, if you have stored mail messages in file
mmssgg.ssaavvee, you can convert this file by typing:

    cvmail msg.save

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, mmaaiill

_N_o_t_e_s
If you invoke ccvvmmaaiill without any  arguments, it prompts you for the name of
a file  to convert.  The file  is not assumed to be  a mailbox in directory
/uussrr/ssppooooll/mmaaiill.
