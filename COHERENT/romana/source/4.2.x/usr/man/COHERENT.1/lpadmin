llppaaddmmiinn -- Command

Administer the lp print-spooler system
llppaaddmmiinn [-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [-mm_s_c_r_i_p_t] [-vv_d_e_v_i_c_e] [-xx_p_r_i_n_t_e_r]

The command llppaaddmmiinn administers the llpp print-spooling system.

Under the  llpp spooler, the system administrator gives  each printer a name.
She also establishes a script for  each class of printers; for example, she
would  prepare one  script  for all  Epson  printers, and  another for  all
PostScript printers.   The script lists  commands that must  be executed to
print the text properly, such as  setting the port into the correct mode or
post-processing    the    text;   Finally,    she    inserts   into    file
/uussrr/ssppooooll/mmllpp/ccoonnttrroollss  an entry  that links  a printer  by name  with its
device and its script.  When a  user spools a job for printing, she selects
the  printer by  name.  (She  can also  use the  command rroouuttee  establish a
default  printer  for   herself.)  The  print  spooler  llppsscchheedd  reads  the
information  established by  the administrator to  ensure that  printing is
managed correctly.

The command  llppaaddmmiinn is designed to  make it easy for  you to perform these
tasks of administration.   With llppaaddmmiinn, you can add a  new printer to your
COHERENT system and link it to  a device and a description script.  You can
also  add or  modify  a description  script,  or drop  a printer.   llppaaddmmiinn
recognizes the following options:

-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
        Select _p_r_i_n_t_e_r for definition or change.   This option is used with
        the option -vv.

-DD_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
        Make _p_r_i_n_t_e_r the default system printer.   This is the printer that
        is used when a user names no printer on the llpp command line and has
        set no default printer for herself.

-mm_s_c_r_i_p_t
        Use _s_c_r_i_p_t to preprocess text to be printed on _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.

-vv_d_e_v_i_c_e
        Associate _d_e_v_i_c_e (a serial or parallel  port) with the printer with
        the option -dd.

-xx_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
        Remove _p_r_i_n_t_e_r from the system.
