AAddmmiinniisstteerriinngg CCOOHHEERREENNTT -- Overview

To administer a COHERENT system, you must know how to do the following:

-> Perform backups, manage archives and purge old files.

-> Set up  and manage  complex system,  such as mail,  UUCP, and  the print
   spooler.

-> Attach peripheral devices, such as terminals, modems, and printers.

-> Install third-party software.

-> Configure the kernel, and add or configure device drivers.

-> Act as a resource person for other users.

Many users  who have  purchased COHERENT for  their personal use  will find
some of these  tasks to be confusing or daunting.   This is especially true
if they have had no previous exposure to UNIX or similar operating systems.
Such a person will find the following Lexicon articles to be helpful:

     The tertiary  boot is the program that loads  the COHERENT kernel into
     memory and launches it.  This article describes it.  You probably will
     never need to work with ttbboooott-- but you never know.

vviirrttuuaall ccoonnssoollee
     COHERENT supports  virtual consoles, whereby  several console sessions
     can be run on the same  physical device.  This describes how to set up
     and manage virtual consoles on your system.

The COHERENT system is controlled by _s_y_s_t_e_m _f_i_l_e_s and _d_a_e_m_o_n_s. System files
contain the information that controls the minute-to-minute operation of the
COHERENT system.   A daemon is a  program that the system  runs to manage a
peripheral  device or  perform some  other task that  does not  require the
intervention  of a  human.  These  files and daemons  are described  in the
