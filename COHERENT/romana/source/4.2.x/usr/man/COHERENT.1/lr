llrr -- Command

List subdirectories' contents in columnar format
llrr [_f_i_l_e ...]

llrr is a link to the command llss -CCRR. It prints each _f_i_l_e in columnar format,
like the command llcc. If a  _f_i_l_e is a directory, llrr also prints its contents
and that of each of its  subdirectories.  If no _f_i_l_e is named, it lists the
contents of the current directory by default.
