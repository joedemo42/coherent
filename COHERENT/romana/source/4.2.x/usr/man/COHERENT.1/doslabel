ddoossllaabbeell [-vv] _d_e_v_i_c_e: _l_a_b_e_l

ddoossllaabbeell puts  _l_a_b_e_l onto an MS-DOS floppy disk.   _d_e_v_i_c_e names the floppy-
disk drive that  holds the disk to be labelled,  such as /ddeevv/ffhhaa00. See the
Lexicon entry ffllooppppyy ddiisskkss for a table of the COHERENT floppy-disk devices.
You can also  build a file of aliases so  that you can access the drives as
aa, bb,  etc.  For details, see  the Lexicon entry for  ddoossccpp, which explains
how to set up defaults for the ddooss family of commands.

The option -vv, tells  ddoossllaabbeell to provide additional information about each
action it performs.
