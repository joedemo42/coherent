ddoossmmkkddiirr  makes  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y in  an  MS-DOS file  system.   _d_e_v_i_c_e names  the
floppy-disk or hard-disk device that  holds the file system to be modified,
e.g.,  /ddeevv/ffhhaa00. You  can also  build a  file of aliases  so that  you can
access the  drives as aa,  bb, etc.  For  details, see the  Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.

defined aa to be a device in which is set an MS-DOS file system:

    dosmkdir a:/mydir
