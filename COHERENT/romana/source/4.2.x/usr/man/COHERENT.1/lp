llpp -- Command

Spool a file for printing
llpp [-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [-tt _t_i_t_l_e] [-nn_c_o_p_i_e_s] [-RR _p_a_g_e [_p_a_g_e]] [-SSmmwwss] _f_i_l_e ...

The  command llpp  spools text  for  printing.  If  you name  no _f_i_l_e  on its
command line, llpp spools what it receives from the standard input.

llpp  prefaces the  spooled text  with a header  that describes,  among other
things, on what device you want  to print the text; then it copies the text
into directory  /uussrr/ssppooooll/mmllpp/qquueeuuee, where it remains  until it is removed
by  the  printer  daemon llppsscchheedd.  The  spooled  text,  which may  comprise
multiple files, plus its header is called a _j_o_b.

The following describes the header with which llpp prefaces each file:

  _O_f_f_s_e_t   _L_e_n_g_t_h  _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
     0       14    User who spooled the file
    14       14    Name of the printer on which to print file
    28       10    Type of file (application specific)
    38       3     Length of output page (default, 66 lines)
    41       4     Number of pages (maximum, 9,999)
    45       2     Number of copies to print (default, one; maximum, 99)
    47       1     Set life expectancy of job (see below)
    48       1     If `M', send user mail after printing
    49       1     If `W', write user after printing
    50       14    Name of data base (application specific)
    64       14    Name of program (application specific)
    78       10    Date/time stamp (no. of seconds since 1/1/1970)
    88       60    Description or title

Note that the  fields marked ``application specific'' are not  use by llpp or
llppsscchheedd. Rather, they are  available to applications, such as filters, that
may be used with llpp to print files.

The ``life expectancy'' byte of the header defines how long the job remains
alive  in /uussrr/ssppooooll/mmllpp/qquueeuuee.  Jobs labelled TT  (temporary) live  for two
hours after being spooled; those labelled SS (short-term) live for 48 hours;
and  those labelled  LL (long-term)  live for  72 days.   Once a  job's life
expectancy has expired, the printer daemon llppsscchheedd removes it.  The default
is life expectancy  is SS.  To change the life  expectancy of a job, use the
command  cchhrreeqq. You  can  also change  the above  default ``lifetimes''  by
editing the file /uussrr/ssppooooll/mmllpp/ccoonnttrroollss.

When llpp creates a job, it gives the job a seven-character name.  The name's
first character gives  the status of the job: RR  indicates that the file is
being printed or is pending printing,  whereas rr indicates that the job has
already  been  printed.   The second  character  gives  the job's  priority
status, from  0 through  9: zero gives  highest priority, nine  the lowest.
The default  priority is 2.   The last five  characters of the  name give a
zero-padded sequence number.  To change a job's status or priority, use the
command  cchhrreeqq; or  the  system administrator  can alter  either simply  by
renaming the file.

llpp recognizes the following options:

-RR _r_e_q_u_e_s_t
          Print a  job beginning from the first  _p_a_g_e and continuing either
          to the  second _p_a_g_e or to  the end of the  document (if no second
          _p_a_g_e  is  specified).   Note  that  the  printer  daemon  llppsscchheedd
          identifies  pages by  counting lines  of  input, so  this feature
          works only  with straight text.  It does  _n_o_t work correctly with
          ``cooked'' input, such as files of PostScript or PCL.

-SS9       Shut down the spooler daemon llppsscchheedd.

-dd_p_r_i_n_t_e_r Print the job on _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.

-mm        Send mail to the user once the spooled job has been printed.

-nn_c_o_p_i_e_s  Print _c_o_p_i_e_s copies of the job.

-ss        Silent -- do  not acknowlege submissions.  Normally, llpp writes on
          the  standard output  the  sequence number  of the  job you  just
          spooled.  You  can use that number  to remove or abort  a job, or
          otherwise manipulate it.

-tt _t_i_t_l_e  Give this job _t_i_t_l_e.  This is the title that appears in the queue
          displayed by the command llppssttaatt.

-ww        Write  a message  on  the user's  screen  once the  job has  been
          printed.

llpp sends you mail if one of your print jobs failed due to an error.

_N_o_t_e_s
Due to the fact that most  users find banners annoying rather than helpful,
llpp does not print banners.  It  ignores the option -bb, which under orthodox
implementations of  llpp prints  a banner  page.  Applications that  desire a
banner  page  should make  provision  for it  in  the individual  printer's
control file.  For details, see the Lexicon entry for the command llppaaddmmiinn.

If you wish to use llpp to download a PCL bitmapped font to your PCL printer,
you must first process the font  with the command ppccllffoonntt. For details, see
its Lexicon entry.
