dduummppddiirr -- Command

Print the directory of a dump
dduummppddiirr [aaff [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...] ]

dduummppddiirr  reads through  a  file-system dump  created by  the dduummpp  command,
gathers up  its directory blocks,  and displays the names  and i-numbers of
all files on the dump.

The aa  option causes dduummppddiirr to  display the directory entries  for `.' and
`..', which are normally suppressed.

The ff  option causes the next  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t to be taken as  the pathname of the
dump device, which is otherwise assumed to be /ddeevv/dduummpp.

If no  options are  specified, dduummppddiirr reads  from the default  dump device
/ddeevv/dduummpp and suppresses the printing of `.' and `..' entries.

_D_i_a_g_n_o_s_t_i_c_s
The dump/restore  format puts a  header at the  beginning of the  dump that
includes all  the information about what lives where  in the dump.  dduummppddiirr
reads this header to discover what files are in the dump.  If the header is
too large to fit onto one  disk, dduummppddiirr will then prompt you to insert the
additional disk  or disks; if  this happens, insert the  requested disk and
then type <rreettuurrnn>.

_N_o_t_e_s
dduummpp requires  that its  output be  written to disks  that are free  of bad
sectors.  If you  write a dump to a disk  with bad sectors, you will not be
able to  restore files  from that  disk.  For details  on using  disks with
dduummpp, see its Lexicon entry.
