hheeaadd -- Command

Print the beginning of a file
hheeaadd [+_n[bbccll]] [_f_i_l_e]
hheeaadd [-_n[bbccll]] [_f_i_l_e]

hheeaadd copies  the first part  of _f_i_l_e, or  of the standard input  if none is
named, to the standard output.

The given  _n_u_m_b_e_r tells hheeaadd where  to begin to copy  the data.  Numbers of
the form +_n_u_m_b_e_r measure the starting point from the beginning of the file;
those of the form -_n_u_m_b_e_r measure from the end of the file.

A specifier of blocks, characters, or  lines (_b, cc, or ll, respectively) may
follow the  number; the  default is  lines.  If no  _n_u_m_b_e_r is  specified, a
default of +4 is assumed.

_N_o_t_e_s
Because hheeaadd buffers  data measured from the end of  the file, large counts
may not work.
