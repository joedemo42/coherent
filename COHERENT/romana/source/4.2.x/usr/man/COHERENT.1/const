ccoonnsstt -- C Keyword

Qualify an identifier as not modifiable

The type qualifier ccoonnsstt marks  an object as being unmodifiable.  An object
declared as  being ccoonnsstt cannot be  used on the left  side of an assignment
(an  _l_v_a_l_u_e), or  have its  value modified  in any  way.  Because  of these
restrictions, an implementation may place objects declared to be ccoonnsstt into
a read-only region of storage.
