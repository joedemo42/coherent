Data type

cchhaarr  is a  C data  type.   It is  the smallest  addressable unit  of data.
According to  the ANSI  Standard, a  cchhaarr consists of  exactly one  byte of
storage;  a  byte, in  turn,  must  be composed  of  at  least eight  bits.
ssiizzeeooff(cchhaarr) returns  one by definition, with all  other data types defined
as multiples thereof.  All Mark Williams compilers sign-extend cchhaarr when it
is cast to a larger data type.

Under COHERENT, a cchhaarr by default is signed.
