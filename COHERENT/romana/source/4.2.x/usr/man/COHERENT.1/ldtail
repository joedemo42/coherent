The COHERENT linker lldd  reads the environmental variables LLDDHHEEAADD and LLDDTTAAIILL
before it begins its work.  You can set these variables to hold the default
options that you want the linker always to use.

lldd appends the options in LLDDTTAAIILL to the end of its command line.
