llppdd -- System Administration

Spooler daemon for line printer
/uussrr/lliibb/llppdd

llppdd is the daemon that prints  listings queued by the command llpprr. All jobs
are printed  on the  printer that is  accessed through device  /ddeevv/llpp. For
information on  this device, and on printer management  in general, see the
Lexicon entry pprriinntteerr.

llpprr  invokes llppdd  automatically.  If  there  is no  printing to  do, or  if
another daemon  is already running (indicated by the  file ddppiidd), llppdd exits
immediately.  Otherwise, it  searches the spool directory for control files
of listings to print.  A control file contains the names of files to print,
the user name, banners, and files to be removed upon completion.

llppdd does not print listings in any particular order.  Priority is not given
to any file, either by size or by requester.
