File systems to check when booting COHERENT
/eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt

The file  /eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt names all  COHERENT partitions on  your hard disk.
COHERENT executes ffsscckk for each file named in this file.  This ensures that
the  file-system of  each partition  is  checked and  cleaned before  it is
mounted.

When you add a new COHERENT partition to your system, you should insert its
name (that  is, the name of  its raw device) into  /eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt to ensure
that its file system is checked at boot time.
