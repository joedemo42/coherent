__TTIIMMEE__ -- Manifest Constant

Time source file is translated

__TTIIMMEE__ is a preprocessor constant  that is defined by the C preprocessor.
It represents  the time that a  source file is translated.   It is a string
literal of the form:

    "hh:mm:ss"

This is the same format used by the function aassccttiimmee.

The  value of  this preprocessor constant  remains constant  throughout the
processing of the translation unit.  It may not be the subject of a #ddeeffiinnee
or #uunnddeeff preprocessing directive.
