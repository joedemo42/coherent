LLAASSTTEERRRROORR -- Environmental Variable

Program that last generated an error
LLAASSTTEERRRROORR=_p_r_o_g_r_a_m _n_a_m_e

The  environmental  variable  LLAASSTTEERRRROORR  names  the  last program  to  have
returned an error  to the shell.  For example, if  you had used the command
sseett with an incorrect number of  arguments, it would have failed to run and
would  have  exited  with an  error  condition,  and  LLAASSTTEERRRROORR would  read
LLAASSTTEERRRROORR=sseett.

The command hheellpp reads LLAASSTTEERRRROORR to determine what the last program was for
which you needed help.  Thus, if you type hheellpp without an argument, it will
return information about the program named in LLAASSTTEERRRROORR.
