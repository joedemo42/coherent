iiddeennaabbllee -- Command

Enable or disable a device driver
/eettcc/ccoonnff/bbiinn/iiddeennaabbllee [-ff _f_i_l_e] [-ddee] _d_r_i_v_e_r

The command iiddeennaabbllee lets you enable  or disable a device driver within the
COHERENT kernel.  _d_r_i_v_e_r is the device driver to enable or disable

The flag -ee tells iiddeennaabbllee to enable _d_r_i_v_e_r. This is the default.

The flag -dd tells iiddeennaabbllee to disable it.

For example,  to enable STREAMS and disable the  pseudo-tty driver ppttyy, use
the following commands:

    /etc/conf/bin/idenable streams
    /etc/conf/bin/idenable -d pty

iiddeennaabbllee's command  line can name  more than one driver.   For example, the
command

    /etc/conf/bin/idenable streams -d pty

is the  equivalent of the  two commands given  above.  The command  line is
parsed from left to right, so  whatever you say last about a driver is what
ultimately happens.

The option -ff forces iiddeennaabbllee to  enable a driver.  If iiddeennaabbllee is directed
to enable a  device that will conflict with another  enabled device in some
way, it normally reports the conflict  and not make the change.  -ff directs
iiddttuunnee to  ``force'' the driver  to be enabled  by simply shutting  off all
other drivers with which a conflict occurs.  For example, this is used with
keyboard drivers, only one of which can occupy a major number at a time.

To   implement   your   changes,  you   must   then   invoke  the   command
/eettcc/ccoonnff/bbiinn/iiddmmkkccoohh  to  build  a new  kernel,  which  will reflect  your
changes, and then boot the new kernel.

iiddeennaabbllee works  by modifying the  file /eettcc/ccoonnff/ssddeevviiccee. It  consists of a
series of lines with the following format:

    streams N   0   0   0   0   0x0   0x0   0x0   0x0
    console Y   0   0   0   0   0x0   0x0   0x0   0x0
    cohmain Y   0   0   0   0   0x0   0x0   0x0   0x0

The first column names the driver in question.  The second column indicates
whether it is incorporated into the kernel.  The other columns give ``magic
cookies'' that describe how the driver works.

You  can  read  /eettcc/ccoonnff/ssddeevviiccee  to  see  how your  kernel  is  currently
configured.  Note,  however, that  you must  _n_e_v_e_r modify ssddeevviiccee  by hand.
iiddeennaabbllee performs consistency checking  to ensure, for example, that you do
not  load two  competing  keyboard drivers  or hard-disk  drivers.  If  you
modify ssddeevviiccee  by hand, you  run the risk  of building a  kernel that that
will not boot or will trash your file system.
