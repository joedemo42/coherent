ccoonnvv [_n_u_m_b_e_r]

ccoonnvv  converts _n_u_m_b_e_r  to hexadecimal,  decimal,  octal, binary,  and ASCII
characters, and prints the results on the standard output.  If no _n_u_m_b_e_r is
given, ccoonnvv  reads one number  per line from  the standard input  until you
type the end-of-file character <ccttrrll-DD>.

_n_u_m_b_e_r may be in  hexadecimal, decimal, octal, binary, or character format,
as shown below.  Each example represents the decimal number 97.

ccoonnvv represents  an ASCII control character in its  output by preceding the
character by a  carat `^'.  For example, it prints  <ccttrrll-XX> as `^X'.  ccoonnvv
prints ``bad digit'' if anything is wrong with the input.

_N_o_t_e_s
ccoonnvv represents  the input _n_u_m_b_e_r internally as a  lloonngg integer.  If _n_u_m_b_e_r
does not fit in a lloonngg, ccoonnvv silently truncates it.
