iippccrrmm -- Command

Remove an interprocess-communication memory item
iippccrrmm [-mmqqss _i_d] [-MMQQSS _k_e_y]

The   command  iippccrrmm   removes  a   memory   item  used   for  interprocess
communication:  either shared-memory segment,  message queue,  or semaphore
set.  You can use this command  either with an _i_d, which is the identifying
number assigned  by the function that created the  memory item in question;
or  with a  _k_e_y,  which is  the  identifier used  by  the application  that
requested the memory item.

iippccrrmm recognizes the following options:

mm _i_d Remove the shared-memory segment with an identifier of _i_d.

qq _i_d Remove the message queue with an identifier of _i_d.

ss _i_d Remove the semaphore set with an identifier of _i_d.

MM _k_e_y
     Remove the shared-memory segment with a key of _k_e_y.

QQ _k_e_y
     Remove the message queue with a key of _k_e_y.

SS _k_e_y
     Remove the semaphore set with a key of _k_e_y.

To  find the  identifiers  and keys  for  for the  IPC  resources that  are
currently allocated, use the command iippccss.

_N_o_t_e_s
iippccrrmm does not remove  a shared-memory segment until all processes attached
to it are removed by calls to the function sshhmmaatt().

Any user can run iippccrrmm; however,  a user can remove only those memory items
that he  ``owns'', as  noted in  the control structure  for the  item.  The
superuser rroooott can, of course, remove all memory items, no questions asked.
