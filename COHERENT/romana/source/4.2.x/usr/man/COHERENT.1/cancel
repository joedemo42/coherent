ccaanncceell -- Command

Cancel a print job
ccaanncceell [_u_s_e_r] [_j_o_b [ ... _j_o_b]] [-aallll]

The command ccaanncceell cancels execution  of a printing job.  It recognizes the
following options:

-_u_s_e_r   Cancel all of the jobs owned by _u_s_e_r.

-aallll    Cancel all requests that are currently executing.

_j_o_b     Cancel each _j_o_b. Each _j_o_b is identified by the number printed by llpp
        when the job was first spooled.

When a job is cancelled, it remains in the print queue for the remainder of
its ``lifetime'', and may be printed  later.  When it cancels a job, ccaanncceell
sends mail to the owner of the job to notify him of the job's cancellation.

ccaanncceell does  not affect jobs  that have already been  downloaded into their
destination printers.   The only way to  stop a job from  printing after it
has  been   downloaded  is  to   clear  the  printer's   memory.   See  the
documentation that  came with  your printer for  instructions on how  to do
that.
