aacc -- Command

Summarize login accounting information
aacc [ -ddpp ] [ -ww _w_f_i_l_e ][ _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e ... ]

One of the accounting mechanisms  available on the COHERENT system is login
accounting, which keeps track of the  time each user spends logged into the
system.  Login  accounting is enabled  by creating the  file /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp.
Thereafter, the routines ddaattee, llooggiinn, and iinniitt write raw accounting data to
/uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp to record the time, the name of the terminal, and the name of
the user for each date change, login, logout, or system reboot.

The command  aacc summarizes the raw accounting data.   By default, aacc prints
the total  connect time found in /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp.  Any _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e restricts the
summary to each specified user.

The following options are available:

-dd   Itemize the output into daily (midnight to midnight) periods.

-pp   Print individual totals.

-ww   Use _w_f_i_l_e rather than /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp as the raw data file.

The  file /uussrr/aaddmm/wwttmmpp  can  become very  large; therefore,  it should  be
truncated periodically.   Special care should be  taken if login accounting
is enabled on a COHERENT system with a small disk.
