bbaadd -- Command

Maintain list of bad blocks
bbaadd [-aaccddll] _d_e_v_i_c_e [ _b_l_o_c_k ... ]

A hard disk or floppy disk  may have bad blocks on it: a ``bad block'' is a
portion of disk that is flawed,  and so cannot reliably be read or written.
It is the unusual disk that is free of bad blocks.

COHERENT  keeps a  list of  bad  blocks so  it can  avoid using  them.  The
command bbaadd maintains this bad-block  list for the given _d_e_v_i_c_e, which must
be  a  block-special  file.   bbaadd  recognizes  the  following  command-line
options:

aa   Add each given _b_l_o_c_k to the bad-block list
cc   Clear the bad-block list
dd   Delete each given _b_l_o_c_k from the bad-block list
ll   List all blocks on the bad-block list

Note that bbaadd  merely adds a block to the  list of bad blocks, or removes a
block from that list.  It does  not deallocate any i-node associated with a
block when  adding it to  the bad-block list.   You should run  the command
iicchheecckk with the option -ss immediately  after bbaadd to correct the problem, or
run the  command ffsscckk. After  you modify the  list of bad  blocks, you must
reboot your system to force the kernel to use this modified list.

The file system  on _d_e_v_i_c_e should be unmounted if  possible.  You must have
appropriate permissions for _d_e_v_i_c_e before you can invoke bbaadd. For many file
systems, only the superuser may use  bbaadd to change the bad-block list.  Use
the command bbaaddssccaann to create a prototype file of bad blocks.

When the  command mmkkffss creates  a file system,  the prototype specification
may include a list of bad blocks for the new file system.
