eennvviirroonn -- C Language

Process environment

eexxtteerrnn cchhaarr **eennvviirroonn;

eennvviirroonn is  an array of strings,  called the _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t of  a process.  By
convention, each string has the form

    _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e

Normally, each process inherits the environment of its parent process.  The
shell sshh and  various forms of eexxeecc can change  the environment.  The shell
adds the  name and value  of each shell  variable marked for  _e_x_p_o_r_t to the
environment of  subsequent commands.  The  shell adds assignments  given on
the  same line  as a  command to  the environment  of the  command, without
affecting subsequent commands.
