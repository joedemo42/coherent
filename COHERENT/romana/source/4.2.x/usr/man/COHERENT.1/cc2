cccc22 -- Definition

cccc22 is the optimizer/object  generator phase of COHERENT.  It optimizes the
code generated by cccc11, and  writes the object code.  COHERENT uses multiple
optimization  algorithms.   One  optimizes  jump sequences:  it  eliminates
common code,  optimizes span-dependent jumps,  and removes jumps  to jumps.
The  other  function  scans  the  generated  code repeatedly  to  eliminate
unnecessary instructions.
