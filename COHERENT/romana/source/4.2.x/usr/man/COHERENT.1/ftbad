ffttbbaadd -- Command

Manipulate bad-block list on a floppy-tape cartridge
ffttbbaadd [-rrww] [_d_e_v_i_c_e]

The command ffttbbaadd  lets you manipulate the list of  bad blocks on a floppy-
tape cartridge.  It recognizes the following options:

-rr Read the  list of bad blocks from floppy-tape  cartridge, and write them
   to the  standard-output device.  The  output will appear  something like
   the following:

       557
       1033
       89640

-ww Read a list  of bad blocks from the standard-input  device, and write it
   onto the floppy-tape cartridge.

To modify the bad block list for a cartridge, use the command

    ftbad -r > badlist

to read the list of bad blocks and write it into file bbaaddlliisstt. You can edit
bbaaddlliisstt;  each line  in this  file  names only  one bad  block, in  decimal
notation.  Then, to write the edited list back onto the tape cartridge, use
the command:

    ftbad -w < badlist

By  default,  ffttbbaadd  manipulates device  /ddeevv/fftt.  If  you  wish  to use  a
different device, name it as the second argument on ffttbbaadd's command line.

Do not change  the bad block list of a  tape that contains data you wish to
retrieve.  You  should use ffttbbaadd  when you see  repeated I/O errors  at the
same block on  a tape, and want to mark  that block as being bad before you
reuse the tape.  _C_a_v_e_a_t _u_t_i_l_i_t_o_r!
