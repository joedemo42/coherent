ddoossllss -- Command

List files on an MS-DOS file system
ddoossllss [-vv] _d_e_v_i_c_e:[/_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y/][_f_i_l_e]

ddoossllss lists all files in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  on an MS-DOS file system.  _d_e_v_i_c_e names
the  floppy-disk or  hard-disk  device that  holds  the file  system to  be
modified, e.g., /ddeevv/ffhhaa00. You can also build a file of aliases so that you
can access the drives as aa, bb, etc.  For details, see the Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.

The option -vv  tells ddoossllss to print its output  in a long format, analogous
to what the command llss -ll prints.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following  displays the contents of directory ssrrcc.  It assumes that you
have defined  cc as a default  for a device on which you  have set an MS-DOS
file system:

    dosls -v c:/src

_F_i_l_e_s
/eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss -- Setup file

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss,  ddooss, ddoossddiirr, llss

_N_o_t_e_s
ddoossllss  does  not  understand  compressed  MS-DOS  file systems  created  by
programs such as SSttaacckkeerr or MS-DOS 6.0 ddbbllssppaaccee.
