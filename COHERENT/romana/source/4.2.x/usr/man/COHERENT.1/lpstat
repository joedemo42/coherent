llppssttaatt -- Command

Give status of printer or job
llppssttaatt [-pp_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [-ddoorrqqssttvv]

The command  llppssttaatt gives information about the operation  of the llpp print-
spooling mechanism.  It recognizes the following options:

-pp _p_r_i_n_t_e_r
       Give the status of _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.

-dd     Name the system's default printer.

-oo     Status of all  printing and pending  requests.  This is  the default
       option.

-rr     Give the status of the daemon llppsscchheedd.

-qq     Give a detailed report of jobs in the queue.  The jobs are displayed
       in two  groups, quiescent  and active,  with  each group  ordered by
       their priority -- which, given llpp's  conventions for naming jobs, is
       identical with their alphabetical order.

-ss     Summarize status of each request and status of each printer.

-tt     Like option -ss, but in somewhat more detail.

-vv     List all available printers and the devices associated with them.
