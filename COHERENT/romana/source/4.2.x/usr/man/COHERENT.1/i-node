COHERENT system file identifier

Each  file on  a COHERENT  file system  is identified  by a  unique number,
called an _i-_n_o_d_e _n_u_m_b_e_r or _i-_n_u_m_b_e_r. Each i-node contains information about
a  file: its  mode, link  count, user  identifier, group  identifier, size,
location on the file system, access time, modify time, and creation time.

The  user refers  to a  file by  a file  name, stored  in a  directory; the
directory entry identifies the file by  its i-node number.  A device and i-
node number  together uniquely  specify a file.   The headers iinnoo.hh  and ii-
nnooddee.hh define, respectively, disk i-nodes and memory i-nodes.
