ffwwttaabbllee -- Command

Build font-width table
ffwwttaabbllee [ -ppttvv ] [ _i_n_f_i_l_e [ _o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] ]

ffwwttaabbllee builds  a binary  font-width table  that can be  read by  ttrrooffff. It
understands PCL  (Printer Control Language)  bitmap fonts for  the Hewlett-
Packard  LaserJet family  of printers (plus  compatibles), .ttffmm  files that
describe fonts built into  the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III, and AFM (Adobe
Font Metric) descriptions of PostScript fonts.

For the typesetting program ttrrooffff to  use a font, it must know the width of
each character  in the font,  and it must  know how to tell  the printer to
select the font.  All of this information is built into a _f_o_n_t-_w_i_d_t_h _t_a_b_l_e,
which ttrrooffff reads when you run it.

COHERENT comes  with font-width tables for  a selected set of  fonts: for a
handful  of  scalable  fonts that  are  included  with standard  PostScript
cartridges, for a  few bit-mapped fonts, and for some  fonts that are built
into the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III.  For a list of the font-width tables
that  are included  with COHERENT,  and for further  information on  how to
manage fonts, see the Lexicon entry for ttrrooffff.

The command ffwwttaabbllee builds new font-width  tables.  It reads a file of font
information from  _i_n_f_i_l_e (or  the standard  input) and writes  a font-width
table for  the font to  _o_u_t_f_i_l_e (or the standard  output).  ffwwttaabbllee assumes
that its input is a bit-mapped soft font.

ffwwttaabbllee recognizes the following options:

-pp _i_n_f_i_l_e is an AFM (Adobe  Font Metric) description for a PostScript font,
   rather than a bit-mapped soft font.  If the font is downloadable, rather
   than built into  a cartridge, use the command PPSSffoonntt  to cook the font's
   .ppffbb  into downloadable  form.  For  more  information, see  the Lexicon
   entry PPSSffoonntt.

-tt _i_n_f_i_l_e is  a Hewlett-Packard .ttffmm  file, which describes a  font that is
   built into  the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet  III, rather than  a bit-mapped
   soft font.

-vv Print a brief font description to the standard error file.
