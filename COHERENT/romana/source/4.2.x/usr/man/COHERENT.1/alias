aalliiaass -- Command

Set an alias
aalliiaass [_n_a_m_e[=_v_a_l_u_e ...]]

The command aalliiaass is used by the Korn shell kksshh to set or display an alias.

When called without an argument, aalliiaass lists all aliases that have been set
so far.   When called with a  _n_a_m_e argument alone, it  lists alias of _n_a_m_e,
assuming one has been set.

When  called  with  one  or  more  arguments of  the  form  _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,  it
established  _n_a_m_e as  an  alias for  the  command _v_a_l_u_e.  For example,  the
command

    alias FOO="echo bar"

establishes  the  string  FFOOOO  as  an  alias  for  the  command  eecchhoo  bbaarr.
Thereafter, when you type FFOOOO on  the shell's command line, it will execute
the command eecchhoo bbaarr and so echo the string bbaarr on your terminal.

The Korn shell sets a number  of aliases by default.  See the Lexicon entry
for kksshh for a list of these aliases and their settings.
