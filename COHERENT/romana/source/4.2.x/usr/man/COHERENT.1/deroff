ddeerrooffff -- Command

Remove text formatting control information
ddeerrooffff [-ww] [-xx] [_f_i_l_e ...]

ddeerrooffff  removes text  formatting control information  from each  input text
_f_i_l_e, or from  the standard input if no _f_i_l_e  is specified.  It regards all
lines  that begin  with `.'  or `''  as being nnrrooffff  or ttrrooffff  commands and
deletes them.   ddeerrooffff also recognizes  some additional control  lines.  It
deletes  eeqqnn  information  (between .EEQQ  and  .EENN  lines), ttbbll  information
(between  .TTSS  and .TTEE  lines),  and macro  definitions.   It also  deletes
embedded .eeqqnn requests.  It expands  source file inclusion with .ssoo and .nnxx
requests,  with the  proviso that  no input  file is  read twice.   It also
deletes  some ttrrooffff  escape  sequences, such  as  those for  font and  size
change.

When the  -xx flag is  present, ddeerrooffff uses some  additional knowledge about
the nnrrooffff -mmss macro package.

When the -ww  flag is present, ddeerrooffff divides the  remaining text into words
and prints them  to the standard output, one per  line.  A wwoorrdd comprises a
sequence of letters, digits,  and apostrophes that commences with a letter.
ddeerrooffff strips  apostrophes from the  output.  All other  characters between
words are  not printed.  The spelling checking programs  ssppeellll and ttyyppoo use
this option.
