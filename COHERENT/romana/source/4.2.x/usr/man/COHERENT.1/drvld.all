ddrrvvlldd.aallll -- System Administration

Load loadable drivers at boot time
/eettcc/ddrrvvlldd.aallll

The file /eettcc/ddrrvvlldd.aallll holds commands to load loadable drivers into memory
when you  boot the COHERENT system.   It is read from  the script /eettcc/bbrrcc,
which is executed whenever the COHERENT system is rebooted into single-user
mode.

Under COHERENT  286, ddrrvvlldd.aallll (as its name implies)  includes calls to the
command ddrrvvlldd  to load loadable  drivers.  COHERENT 386  does not implement
loadable device  drivers; however, it  uses ddrrvvlldd.aallll to  load the keyboard
table and perform other useful work.
