ddiirreeccttoorryy -- Definition

A  ddiirreeccttoorryy is  a  table that  maps  names to  files; in  other words,  it
associates the  names of a  file with their  locations on the  mass storage
device.  Under some operating  systems, directories are also files, and can
be handled like a file.

Directories  allow files  to be  organized on  a mass  storage device  in a
rational manner, by function or owner.
