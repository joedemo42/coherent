eexxppoorrtt -- Command

Add a shell variable to the environment
eexxppoorrtt [_n_a_m_e ...]
eexxppoorrtt [_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e]

When the shell executes a command, it passes the command an _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t. By
convention,  the environment  consists  of assignments,  each  of the  form
_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e. For example, typing

    export TERM=vt100

sets the environmental variable TTEERRMM to equal the string vvtt110000.

A command may look for information  in the environment or may simply ignore
it.  In the above example, a  program that reads the variable TTEERRMM (such as
COHERENT) will assume that you are  working on a DEC VT-100 terminal or one
that emulates it.

The shell places the _n_a_m_e and the value of each shell variable that appears
in  an  eexxppoorrtt  command  into  the  environment  of  subsequently  executed
commands.  It does not place a shell variable into the environment until it
appears in an eexxppoorrtt command.

With  no arguments,  eexxppoorrtt prints  the name  and the  value of  each shell
variable currently marked for export.

The shell executes eexxppoorrtt directly.
