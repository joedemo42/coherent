ccaall -- Command

Print a calendar
ccaall [ _m_o_n_t_h ] [ _y_e_a_r ]

ccaall  prints a  calendar for  the  specified _y_e_a_r  (by default,  the current
year),  or  for  the given  _m_o_n_t_h  if  one  is  specified.  If  neither  is
specified,  a calendar  of  the current  month  is printed.   _y_e_a_r must  be
between  1 and  9999.  _m_o_n_t_h  may  be either  the month  name (lower  case,
spelled out or first three letters) or a number between 1 and 12.

For example, try:

    cal september 1752

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss

_N_o_t_e_s
ccaall assumes  that the Gregorian calendar was adopted  on September 3, 1752,
which is the date of its adoption throughout the British empire.
