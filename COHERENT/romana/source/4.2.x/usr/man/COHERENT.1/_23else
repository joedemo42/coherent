#eellssee -- Preprocessing Directive

Include code conditionally

The  preprocessing directive  #eellssee  conditionally includes  code within  a
program.  It is preceded by one  of the directives #iiff, #iiffddeeff, or #iiffnnddeeff,
and  may also  be  preceded by  any  number of  #eelliiff  directives.  If  the
conditional  expressions  of all  preceding  directives  evaluate to  false
(i.e., to zero),  then the code introduced by #eellssee  is included within the
program, up to the #eennddiiff directive.

A  #iiff, #iiffddeeff,  or #iiffnnddeeff  directive can  be followed  by only  one #eellssee
directive.
