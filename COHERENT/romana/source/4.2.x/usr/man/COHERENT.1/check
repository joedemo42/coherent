cchheecckk -- Command

Check file system
cchheecckk [-ss] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...

cchheecckk uses  the commands iicchheecckk  and ddcchheecckk to  check the consistency  of a
file system.  It  acts on each argument _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m in  turn; it calls first
iicchheecckk and then ddcchheecckk on each to detect problems.

If -ss is specified, cchheecckk attempts to repair any errors automatically.  You
should first unmount  the file system, if possible.  If  the root device is
involved,  you should  be in  single-user mode and  then reboot  the system
immediately (without typing ssyynncc).

_N_o_t_e_s
Certain errors,  such as duplicated blocks,  cannot be fixed automatically.
Decisions must be made by a human.

In earlier releases of COHERENT, cchheecckk  acted upon a default file system if
none was specified.

This command has largely been superceded by ffsscckk.
