ffcc -- Command

Edit and re-execute one or more previous commands
ffcc [-ee _e_d_i_t_o_r] [-llnn] [_f_i_r_s_t [_l_a_s_t]]

ffcc, the  ``fix command'', is  a command built  into the Korn  shell kksshh. It
permits you  to edit  and re-execute  one or more  commands that  have been
executed previously.

ffcc selects commands _f_i_r_s_t through _l_a_s_t and inserts them into a text editor.
You  can edit  the commands  in  the editor;  exiting from  the editor  re-
executes  the commands.   _f_i_r_s_t and  _l_a_s_t  can be  addressed either  by the
command's number (the first command issued  to the shell is number one, the
second is number two, and so on), or by a string that matches the beginning
of the  command.  When called without a _l_a_s_t  variable, the command selects
just _f_i_r_s_t.  Option -ll  prints the commands  on the standard  output rather
than  buffering  the  commands for  editing  and  re-execution.  Option  -nn
suppresses the default command numbers.

ffcc  uses the  editor named  in the environmental  variable FFCCEEDDIITT;  if this
variable is  not set, it  uses MicroEMACS.  The  option -ee lets  you select
another editor.
