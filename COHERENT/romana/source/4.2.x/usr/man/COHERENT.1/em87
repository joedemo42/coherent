eemm8877 -- Kernel Module

Perform/emulate hardware floating-point operations

The  kernel  module  eemm8877  performs  or  emulates  hardware  floating-point
operations.  Whether  it performs the  operations or emulates  them depends
whether your  computer contains a mathematics  co-processor.  Note that the
Intel 80486-DX processor has the co-processor built in.

eemm8877 is called  a _k_e_r_n_e_l _m_o_d_u_l_e because you can  link it into the kernel or
exclude it from the kernel, just  like a device driver.  However, it is not
a true  device driver  because it  does not perform  I/O from  a peripheral
device.   To install  eemm8877 into  a kernel (should  your kernel  not already
contain  it),  log in  as  the  superuser rroooott  and  execute the  following
commands:

    cd /etc/conf
    em87/mkdev
    bin/idmkcoh -o /_k_e_r_n_e_l__n_a_m_e

where _k_e_r_n_e_l__n_a_m_e  is the name of  the new kernel to  build.  When you next
boot COHERENT, hardware floating point will be enabled.
