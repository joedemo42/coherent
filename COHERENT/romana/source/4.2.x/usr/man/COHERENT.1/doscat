ddoossccaatt -- Command

Concatenate a file on an MS-DOS file system
ddoossccaatt _d_e_v_i_c_e:[/_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y/]_f_i_l_e

ddoossccaatt concatenates  _f_i_l_e that  is in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  on an MS-DOS  file system.
_d_e_v_i_c_e names the floppy-disk or hard-disk device that holds the file system
to be  modified, e.g., /ddeevv/ffhhaa00. You  can also build a  file of aliases so
that  you can  access the  drives  as aa:,  bb:, etc.   For details,  see the
Lexicon entry for ddoossccpp, which explains  how to set up defaults for the ddooss
family of commands.

_f_i_l_e can name either a single  file, or can contain a wildcard character to
name more than one file.  For example, the command

    doscat a:foo.c

concatenates file  ffoooo.cc which  is on the  file system contained  in device
whose alias  is aa: (as  defined in file  /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss). Likewise, the
command

    doscat 'c:/dirname/*.txt'

concatenates all files with the suffix .ttxxtt in directory ddiirrnnaammee, which, in
turn,  is on  the file  system contained  in device whose  alias is  cc: (as
defined in  file /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss). In  this form of  the command, ddoossccaatt
concatenates the files in the alphabetical order of their names.  Note that
the tail of  the command must be enclosed within  apostrophes, or the shell
will expand the `*' before it is read by ddoossccaatt.

_N_o_t_e_s
ddoossccaatt  does  not  understand compressed  MS-DOS  file  systems created  by
programs such as SSttaacckkeerr or MS-DOS  6.0 ddbbllssppaaccee. If you are running MS-DOS
with file  compression, you must copy files to  an uncompressed file system
(for example,  to an uncompressed  floppy disk or to  the uncompressed host
for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the ddoossccaatt.
