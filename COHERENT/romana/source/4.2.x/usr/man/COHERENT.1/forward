.ffoorrwwaarrdd -- System Administration

Set a forwarding address for mail

The file  $HHOOMMEE/.ffoorrwwaarrdd lets you set one or  more forwarding addresses for
mail.  The list must be separated by commas.

For example,  the user  xxmmaaiill under COHERENT  is the recipient  of encypted
mail.   If you  wish, you  can write  the following  into file  .ffoorrwwaarrdd in
xxmmaaiill's home directory:

    root, xmail@mwc.com

Thereafter, whenever a user  sends encrypted mail, copies will be forwarded
to the superuser rroooott and to account xxmmaaiill on system mmwwcc.ccoomm.

Note that  for obvious reasons,  it is illegal  to include in  .ffoorrwwaarrdd the
name of the user whose mail is being forwarded.  For example, writing

    xmail, piggy, xmail@mwc.com

into xxmmaaiill's .ffoorrwwaarrdd file is illegal.
