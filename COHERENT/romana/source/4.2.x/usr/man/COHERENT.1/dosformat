ddoossffoorrmmaatt -- Command

Build an MS-DOS file system
ddoossffoorrmmaatt [-vv] _d_e_v_i_c_e:

ddoossffoorrmmaatt builds  an MS-DOS file  system on a  floppy disk.  The  disk must
first have  been formatted with  the command ffddffoorrmmaatt -vv.  _d_e_v_i_c_e names the
floppy-disk drive that  holds the disk to receive the  file system, such as
/ddeevv/ffhhaa00. See the  Lexicon entry ffllooppppyy ddiisskkss for a  table of the COHERENT
floppy-disk devices.  You can also build  a file of aliases so that you can
access the  drives as AA,  BB, etc.  For  details, see the  Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.  Note that  the device name must always be  suffixed with a colon
`:', just like an MS-DOS device name.

The option -vv, tells ddoossffoorrmmaatt to provide additional information about each
action it performs.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following example  formats a disk.  It assumes that  you have defined aa
as a default for a device upon which is set an MS-DOS file system:

    dosformat a:

_F_i_l_e_s
/eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss -- Setup file

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss,  ddooss, ffddffoorrmmaatt

_N_o_t_e_s
To create  a double-sided, double-density formatted floppy  disk in drive 0
(drive A),  use /ddeevv/ffqqaa00  for 3.5-inch  disks, or /ddeevv/ff99aa00  for 5.25-inch
disks.
