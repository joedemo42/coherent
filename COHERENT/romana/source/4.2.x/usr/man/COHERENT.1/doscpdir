ddoossccppddiirr -- Command

Copy a directory to/from an MS-DOS file system
ddoossccppddiirr [-aakkmmvv] _s_r_c _d_e_s_t

ddoossccppddiirr copies a directory and  its contents between an MS-DOS file system
and a COHERENT file system.  The  MS-DOS file system can reside either on a
floppy disk, or on the MS-DOS segment of a hard disk on your system.

_s_r_c names the directory being copied  and the file system where it resides;
_d_e_s_t names  the file system  and directory into  which the file  is copied.
The operating system  that owns the _s_r_c file is  implied by the name of the
file system on which it resides.  An MS-DOS file system must be named using
the device that holds it,  such as floppy-disk drive /ddeevv/ffhhaa00 or hard-disk
partition /ddeevv/aatt00aa. You  can also build a file of  aliases so that you can
access the  drives as aa,  bb, etc.  For  details, see the  Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.

ddoossccppddiirr converts a file's  name from one operating system's conventions to
the other's.   An MS-DOS file argument  may be specified in  lower or upper
case, using  `/' as the path-name separator.   When transferring files from
MS-DOS to  COHERENT, ddoossccppddiirr  converts an MS-DOS  file name to  a COHERENT
file  name  in lower  case  only.   If the  MS-DOS  file  name contains  no
extension, the COHERENT file name contains no `.'.  When transferring files
from COHERENT  to MS-DOS, ddoossccppddiirr converts all  alphabetic characters in a
COHERENT file name to upper case;  if a period `.' appears at the beginning
or end of a file name, ddoossccppddiirr converts it to `_'.  ddoossccppddiirr truncates the
part of the file name before  the last `.' to a maximum of eight characters
and truncates the extension to a maximum of three characters.

ddoossccppddiirr recognizes the following options:

aa    Perform ASCII newline  conversion on file transfer.  When moving files
     from COHERENT  to MS-DOS, this  option converts each  COHERENT newline
     character `\n' (ASCII LF) to  an MS-DOS end-of-line (ASCII CR and LF).
     When moving  files from MS-DOS to COHERENT, it  does the opposite.  By
     default,  ddoossccppddiirr performs  ASCII conversion  on  files that  have an
     ASCII extention.

kk    Keep: give  the copied file the  same time stamp as  its original.  By
     default, ddoossccppddiirr gives copied files the current time.

mm    Same as aa, described above

vv    Verbose.  Provide additional information about each action performed.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The  following  command copies  COHERENT  directory  /uussrr/ssrrcc to  directory
/mmyyddiirr on  the MS-DOS  file system.  It  assumes that you  have set cc  as a
default for a hard-disk device:

    doscpdir -va /usr/src c:/mydir

_F_i_l_e_s
/eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss -- Setup file

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, ccppddiirr, ddooss

_N_o_t_e_s
ddoossccppddiirr does not  check for unusual characters in a  COHERENT file name or
for file names that differ from other file names only in case.

ddoossccppddiirr  does not  understand compressed  MS-DOS  file systems  created by
programs such as SSttaacckkeerr or MS-DOS  6.0 ddbbllssppaaccee. If you are running MS-DOS
with file  compression, you must copy files to  an uncompressed file system
(for example,  to an uncompressed  floppy disk or to  the uncompressed host
for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the ddoossccppddiirr.
