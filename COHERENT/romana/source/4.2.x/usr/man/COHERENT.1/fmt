ffmmtt -- Command

Adjust the length of lines in a file of text
ffmmtt [-_w_i_d_t_h] [_t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e ... _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e]

The command ffmmtt reads each _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e  named on its command line, and adjusts
it so that each line  is approximately _w_i_d_t_h characters long.  It preserves
indentation and word spacing.

If you name no _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e on  its command line, ffmmtt reads the standard input.
If you do not name a _w_i_d_t_h on the command line, ffmmtt adjusts each line to be
approximately 72 characters long.
