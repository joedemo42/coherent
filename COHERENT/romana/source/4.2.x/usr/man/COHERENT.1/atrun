Execute commands at a preset time

aattrruunn is a program that executes programs at a time set by the command aatt.

When user sstteevvee types

    at 1230 /v/steve/lunchtime

the  command aatt  creates  a shell  script in  directory /uussrr/ssppooooll/aatt  that
contains the information  needed to execute command /vv/sstteevvee/lluunncchhttiimmee at a
later  time --  in  this instance,  12:30  PM.  The  spooled  file sits  in
/uussrr/ssppooooll/aatt until  /uussrr/lliibb/aattrruunn sees that  the specified time  has been
reached.   aattrruunn then  executes  the spooled  command and  removes it  from
/uussrr/ssppooooll/aatt.

aattrruunn is not a daemon; that  is, it is invoked by another program, does its
work, and exits.   Thus, it is typically run periodically  from an entry in
the ccrroonnttaabb file owned by the superuser rroooott.

Although aattrruunn technically is a command,  it is never invoked directly by a
user.
