ddiiffff33 -- Command

Summarize differences among three files
ddiiffff33 [-eexx33] _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 _f_i_l_e_3

ddiiffff33 summarizes  the differences among three  text files.  Each difference
encountered is headed by one of the following separators, which categorizes
how many of the three input files differ in a given range.  The headers are
as follows

====    All of the files are different.

====_n   Only the _nth file differs, where _n may be 1, 2, or 3.

For each set of changes marked as above, the actual change is indicated for
each file  using a notation similar  to commands to eedd.  For each _f_i_l_e_n the
following is printed:

_n: _laa   Text is to be appended after line _l in _f_i_l_e_n.

_n: _l,_mcc
        The text from  line _l  to line _m  is to  be changed for  _f_i_l_e_n. The
        original text  from  _f_i_l_e_n  follows this  line.   If  this text  is
        identical for two of  the files, only the  latter (higher numbered)
        of the two is printed.

Options are available to print a  script of commands to eedd. Option -ee tells
ddiiffff33 to generate  a script that makes all changes  between _f_i_l_e_2 and _f_i_l_e_3
to _f_i_l_e_1. This script is based upon all changes flagged with the separators
==== or ====33, as described above.

The option -xx prints only those changes where all three files differ, i.e.,
those flagged with ====.

The option -33 requests only those changes where _f_i_l_e_3 differs.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following command sequence produces  a script, applies it to _f_i_l_e_1, and
sends the result to the standard output.

    (diff3 -e file1 file2 file3; echo '1,$p') | ed - file1

_D_i_a_g_n_o_s_t_i_c_s
An  exit status  of  zero indicates  all  three files  were identical,  one
indicates differences, and two indicates some other failure.
