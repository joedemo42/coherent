bboooottttiimmee -- System Administration

File that holds time system was last booted

/eettcc/bboooottttiimmee is an empty file maintained  by the iinniitt process and the ddaattee
command.  The modification time of bboooottttiimmee, as displayed by the command llss
-ll, is  the time that  the system was  last booted.  You can  read the time
shown by bboooottttiimmee with llss -ll, or with the system calls ssttaatt or ffssttaatt.

Commands  that depend  upon /eettcc/bboooottttiimmee may  malfunction if  the system's
date is not set correctly.  For  instance, the mmoouunntt command depends on the
relative  modification  times  of  /eettcc/bboooottttiimmee  and /eettcc/mmttaabb  to  detect
whether the mount table has been invalidated by a system boot.  If the date
is set  sufficiently far into  the past, the  mount table may  appear to be
valid when in fact it is not.
