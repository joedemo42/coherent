iinnffooccmmpp -- Command

De-compile a terminfo file
iinnffooccmmpp [_f_i_l_e ... ]

iinnffooccmmpp  reads a  set  of compiled  terminal information,  and decodes  its
contents.  It does its best to  recreate the tteerrmmiinnffoo source from which the
set of information had been compiled.

_f_i_l_e must hold  compiled tteerrmmiinnffoo information.  If no _f_i_l_e  is named on the
command line, iinnffooccmmpp reads the standard input.

iinnffooccmmpp  first  seeks _f_i_l_e  in  the directory  named  by the  environmental
variable TTEERRMMIINNFFOO. If this variable has  not been set, it seeks _f_i_l_e in the
default directory /uussrr/lliibb/tteerrmmiinnffoo. Thus, you can type the command

    infocmp ansipc

in any directory and iinnffooccmmpp builds the appropriate path on its own.

In case  of emergency, the output  of iinnffooccmmpp can be  piped to the tteerrmmiinnffoo
compiler ttiicc.
