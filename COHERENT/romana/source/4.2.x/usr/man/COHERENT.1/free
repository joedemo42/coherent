Return dynamic memory to free memory pool

ffrreeee() helps  you manage  the arena.   It returns to  the free  memory pool
memory  that  had  previously  been  allocated  by mmaalllloocc(),  ccaalllloocc(),  or
rreeaalllloocc().  ffrreeee() marks  the  block indicated  by  _p_t_r as  unused, so  the
mmaalllloocc() search can coalesce it with contiguous free blocks.  _p_t_r must have
been obtained from mmaalllloocc(), ccaalllloocc(), or rreeaalllloocc().

ffrreeee() prints  a message and calls  aabboorrtt() if it discovers  that the arena
has  been corrupted.   This most  often occurs by  storing data  beyond the
bounds of an allocated block.
