EEOOFF -- Manifest Constant

Indicate end of a file
#iinncclluuddee <ssttddiioo.hh>

EEOOFF is an indicator that is returned by several STDIO functions to indicate
that the current file position is the end of the file.

Many STDIO  functions, when  they read  EEOOFF, set the  end-of-file indicator
that is  associated with the  stream being read.   Before more data  can be
read from the stream, its end-of-file indicator must be cleared.  Resetting
the  file-position indicator  with the functions  ffsseeeekk, ffsseettppooss,  or fftteellll
will clear the indicator, as will  returning a character to the stream with
the function uunnggeettcc.
