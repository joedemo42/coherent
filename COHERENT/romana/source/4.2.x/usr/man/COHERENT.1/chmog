cchhmmoogg -- Command

Change mode, owner, and group simultaneously
cchhmmoogg _m_o_d _o_w_n _g_r_p _f_i_l_e ...

cchhmmoogg combines  the functionality of  the commands cchhmmoodd,  cchhoowwnn, and cchhggrrpp
into  one  command.  This  lets  you fine-tune  the  permissions on   _f_i_l_es
without having to type three separate commands.

The arguments  _m_o_d_e, _o_w_n, and _g_r_p give, respectively,  the mode, owner, and
group to  which cchhmmoogg sets _f_i_l_e.  Setting any of these  three arguments `-'
means that that feature of _f_i_l_e is not changed.  For example, the command

    chmog - bin bin file_name

changes the  owner and group  of file ffiillee_nnaammee  to bbiinn and  does not alter
ffiillee_nnaammee's permissions.

For details on how to set  _m_o_d_e, _o_w_n, and _g_r_p, see the Lexicon entries for,
respectively, cchhmmoodd, cchhoowwnn, and cchhggrrpp.
