ccooppyy -- Command

Copy a group of files or directories
ccooppyy [-nnmmoorrvv] _s_o_u_r_c_e [... _s_o_u_r_c_e] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n

The command ccooppyy copies each _s_o_u_r_c_e into directory _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n. If a _s_o_u_r_c_e
is  a  directory,  then  ccooppyy  copies  it and  all  files  within  it  into
_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n. Thus, ccooppyy combines aspects  of the commands ccpp and ccppddiirr into
one command.

ccooppyy recognizes the following command-line options:

-mm   Set the modification  time of each duplicate file to  that of the file
     from which it was copied.  By default, ccooppyy sets the modification time
     of each duplicate file to the time it was created.

-nn   Copy a  _s_o_u_r_c_e file only  if it is  new.  If _s_o_u_r_c_e  already exists in
     directory _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n, do not overwrite it.  This flag does not affect
     the copying of a directory (although it does affect the copying of the
     files within  a directory that is being copied).   ccooppyy also sets this
     flag implicitly when you copy special files.

-oo   Preserve the  ownership of each  _s_o_u_r_c_e file.  With  this option, ccooppyy
     sets the ownership of each duplicate file to that of the user who owns
     the corresponding _s_o_u_r_c_e file.  By default, ccooppyy sets the ownership of
     each duplicate file to that of the user who invoked ccooppyy.

-rr   Copy a directory recursively.  If _s_o_u_r_c_e is a directory, then copy all
     of  its  sub-directories  and  their  contents  into  _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  By
     default, ccooppyy does not copy sub-directories or their contents.

-vv   Tell ccooppyy to print verbose messages of what it is doing.

The behavior of  ccooppyy is not affected by the  order in which options appear
on its command line.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
The first example copies all C source files in the current directory into a
directory named aarrcchhiivvee:

    copy *.c archive

The next example  copies into aarrcchhiivvee all C source  files and the directory
hheeaaddeerr:

    copy header *.c archive

The final example recursively copies into aarrcchhiivvee all files under directory
lliibbrraarryy, as  well as all  C source files; and  preserves their modification
times:

    copy -rm library *.c archive

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, ccpp ccppddiirr

_N_o_t_e_s
If _s_o_u_r_c_e is a special file,  ccooppyy will copy it, but will not copy any data
associated with it.
