eexx -- Command

Berkeley-style line editor
eexx [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ +_c_m_d ] [ _f_i_l_e_1 ... _f_i_l_e_2_7 ]

eexx is a  link to eellvviiss, which is a clone  of the UNIX vvii/eexx set of editors.
Invoking  eellvviiss through  this link  forces it to  operate solely  in colon-
command mode, just as the UNIX eexx editor operates.

For information on how to use  this version of eexx, see the Lexicon page for
eellvviiss.
