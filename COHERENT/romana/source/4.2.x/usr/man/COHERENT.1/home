The  environmental variable  HHOOMMEE name's the  user's home  directory.  Some
commands use this  name by default if they require  the name of a directory
and  none is  supplied.   For example,  if  you type  the change  directory
command ccdd without an argument, it will change the current directory to the
one named by the HHOOMMEE.
