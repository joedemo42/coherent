eellssee -- C Keyword

Introduce a conditional statement

eellssee is the flip side of an iiff statement: if the condition described in the
iiff statement  fails, then the  statements introduced by  the eellssee statement
are executed.  For example,

    if (getchar() == EOF)
        exit(0);
    else
        dosomething();

exits if the user types EEOOFF,  but does something if the user types anything
else.
