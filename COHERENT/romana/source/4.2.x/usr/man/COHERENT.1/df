ddff -- Command

Measure free space on disk
ddff [-ffiivv] [-tt_f_i_l_e_s_y_s] (default format)
ddff [-aaiitt] [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ...] [_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...] (old format)

ddff measures the  amount of space left free on  the file system _f_i_l_e_s_y_s. The
file system being  measured can reside on a hard  disk, floppy disk, or RAM
disk.  For  example, to check  the amount of  space left on  file system xx,
type:

    df /x

If you  do not name  a _f_i_l_e_s_y_s, ddff  prints information only  about the file
system that you in.

By default, ddff  prints three statistics: the number of  disk blocks free on
this device, the total number of disk blocks in the device, and the percent
of total  disk blocks that  is free.  Note  that a disk block  is 512 bytes
(1/2 kilobyte).

Beginning with  release 4.2 of  COHERENT, COHERENT release  4.2 changed the
behavior of  ddff to conform to  the UNIX standard.  This  changes the set of
command-line options that ddff recognizes,  and the manner in which it writes
its information to the standard output.  Some scripts, such as installation
scripts, expect to see ddff to  be in a particular format.  To have ddff format
its output in manner it did prior to release 4.2 of COHERENT, set the line

    export DF_OLD=TRUE

into your .pprrooffiillee.

ddff recognizes the following command-line options:

-aa Print information on all mounted file systems.  (Old format only.)

-ff Suppress i-node information.  (Default format only.)

-ii Give the percentage of i-nodes available used.

-tt Give the number of blocks and i-nodes used on _f_i_l_e_s_y_s.

-vv Give the percentage of blocks used.  (Default format only.)
