ddoossddeell -- Command

Delete a file from an MS-DOS file system
ddoossddeell [-ffvv] _d_e_v_i_c_e:/_d_i_r/_f_i_l_e

ddoossddeell deletes  _f_i_l_e that  lives on  MS-DOS file-system _d_e_v_i_c_e.  The MS-DOS
file system can reside either on a floppy disk, or on the MS-DOS segment of
a hard disk on your system.  The MS-DOS file system must be named using the
device  that holds  it, such  as floppy-disk  drive /ddeevv/ffhhaa00  or hard-disk
partition /ddeevv/aatt00aa. You  can also build a file of  aliases so that you can
access the  drives as aa,  bb, etc.  For  details, see the  Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.

ddoossddeell takes the following options:

ff  Force removal of rreeaaddoonnllyy files.

vv  Verbose output: provide additional information about each action.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following command deletes mmyyffiillee. It assumes that you have defined cc to
be a default for a device upon which you have set an MS-DOS file system:

    dosdel c:/mydir/myfile

_F_i_l_e_s
/eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/mmssddooss -- Setup file

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o
ccoommmmaannddss, ddooss

_N_o_t_e_s
ddoossddeell  does  not  understand compressed  MS-DOS  file  systems created  by
programs such as SSttaacckkeerr or MS-DOS  6.0 ddbbllssppaaccee. If you are running MS-DOS
with file  compression, you must copy files to  an uncompressed file system
(for example,  to an uncompressed  floppy disk or to  the uncompressed host
for a compressed file system) to make them accessible to the ddoossddeell.
