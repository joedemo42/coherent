ddoossrrmm -- Command

Remove a file from an MS-DOS file system
ddoossrrmm _d_e_v_i_c_e:[/_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y/]_f_i_l_e

ddoossrrmm removes  _f_i_l_e from _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y on an MS-DOS  file system.  _d_e_v_i_c_e names
the  floppy-disk or  hard-disk  device that  holds  the file  system to  be
modified, e.g., /ddeevv/ffhhaa00. You can also build a file of aliases so that you
can access the drives as aa, bb, etc.  For details, see the Lexicon entry for
ddoossccpp,  which  explains how  to  set  up defaults  for  the  ddooss family  of
commands.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e
The following deletes all .cc files  on an MS-DOS disk.  It assumes that you
have defined bb to be a device on which you have set an MS-DOS file system:

    dosrm 'b:*.c'
