ggrreepp -- Command

Pattern search
ggrreepp [-aabbcceeffhhiillnnssvvxxyy] [_p_a_t_t_e_r_n] [_f_i_l_e ...]

ggrreepp searches each _f_i_l_e for  occurrences of the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (sometimes called a
regular expression).   If no _f_i_l_e is specified,  ggrreepp searches the standard
input.  The  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is given in  the same manner as  to eedd. Normally, ggrreepp
prints each line matching the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

ggrreepp recognizes the following command-line options:

-bb  With each output line, print the block number in which the line started
    (used to search file systems).

-cc  Print the count of matching lines rather than the lines.

-ee  The next argument is _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (useful if the pattern starts with `-').

-ff  The next argument  is a file that contain a  list of patterns separated
    by newlines; there is no _p_a_t_t_e_r_n argument.

-hh  When  more  than  one _f_i_l_e  is  specified,  output  lines are  normally
    accompanied by the file name; -hh suppresses this.

-ii  Ignore case  when matching letters in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  For  example, an `a' in
    _p_a_t_t_e_r_n matches either `a' or `A'  in _f_i_l_e; likewise, an `A' in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
    matches either `a' or `A'.

-ll  Print the  name of each file containing matching  lines rather than the
    lines.

-nn  The line number in the file accompanies each line printed.

-ss  Suppress all output, just return status.

-vv  Print a line if the pattern is _n_o_t found in the line.

-xx  Print the  line only if  it is exactly  the same as  the pattern; treat
    wildcards in the pattern as plain text.

-yy  Lower-case letters in  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n match only upper-case letters within the
    input lines.

_L_i_m_i_t_s
The COHERENT implementation of ggrreepp  sets the following limits on input and
output:

     Characters per input record        512
     Characters per output record       512
     Characters per field               512

_D_i_a_g_n_o_s_t_i_c_s
ggrreepp returns  an exit status of  zero for success, one  for no matches, two
for error.

_N_o_t_e_s
ccggrreepp  is  a  version  of  ggrreepp  that is  optimized  for  handling  C-style
expressions.

eeggrreepp is an extended and faster version of ggrreepp.
