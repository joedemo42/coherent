#
# A sample backend script.
#
# The despooler opens the spool file and device.  It connects these files
# to THIS process's standard input and output.  Anything you send to
# standard output is likely to end up on paper.  The "cat" command below
# transfers the request data to the device.  Notice how we put banners
# on the front of each request and how we ensure that the printer is at
# top-of-form for the next request in line.
#
# You can get as fancy or spartan as you want insofar as banners are
# concerned.  Business users in particular hate banners because they
# consume paper.
#
# You can also use this backend as an opportunity to transform the raw
# report text in some way before you write it to the device.
#
# These parameters are passed to this process:
#
#    $1 = request sequence number
#    $2 = user name
#    $3 = number of copies
