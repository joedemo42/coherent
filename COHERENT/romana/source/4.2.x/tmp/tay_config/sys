# The following is the configuration needed for mwcbbs. You will have
# to edit SERIALNUM to be the serial number used when you installed COH.
#
# The first number given is the 2400 bps generic access line. The alternates
# give the phone numbers for the Telebit T2500 and USR Dual Standard modems
# on mwcbbs.
#
# Port MODEM must be properly defined in /usr/lib/uucp/port.
# The MODEM information in the port file relies upon the information in the
# file /usr/lib/uucp/dial.
