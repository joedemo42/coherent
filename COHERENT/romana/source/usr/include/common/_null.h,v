/*
 * This internal header factors out the definition of NULL from all other
 * aspects of the STREAMS and device systems.  To create a reasonable
 * facsimile of the STREAMS and DDI/DDK programming environments, many of
 * the header files defined by those documents in the System V environment
 * have been defined.  From the POSIX and ISO C standards documents, we learn
 * that <sys/types.h> is the most likely candidate, but that definitions also
 * occur in <stdlib.h>, <stdio.h>, and many other places.
 */

/*
 * For Borland C++, the use of memory models requires that we define NULL
 * appropriately.  There is a special Borland header for this, however.
