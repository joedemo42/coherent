/*
 * This internal header file defines the internal data type '__va_alist'.
 * This type is equivalent to the ISO C data type 'va_alist', but has an
 * internal name so that headers can refer to it without exporting the name
 * to user-level.
 *
 * In most cases where we perform this subterfuge, we do it as a matter of
 * good style; here, however, we do it to comply with the namespace
 * provisions of POSIX.1, because the name of the user-level type does
 * not end in "_t" and thus is not implicitly reserved by POSIX.1, as
 * most other type-names are.
