/*
 * This internal header file define the internal data type "__clock_t".
 * It resembles the ISO C data type "clock_t", but with an internal name,
 * so that headers that need this type need not import it into the user's
 * namespace.
 *
 * Several specifications  - including iBCS2 and the System V ABI - define
 * "clock_t" as an unsigned long; POSIX.1 and the C standard permit the use
 * of an unsigned type (which dramatically extends the range of times that
 * can be represented).
 *
 * Therefore, we select the type here on the basis of feature-test macros.
