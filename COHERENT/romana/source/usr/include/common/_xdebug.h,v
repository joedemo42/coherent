/*
 * This file contains some simple macros for use in debugging and statistics
 * gathering code. Centralizing these definitions has no real purpose other
 * than increasing consistency for the person attempting to test code.
 *
 * Note that it would be nice if we could hook this into a source-code
 * control system's notion of version, so that in addition to file name,
 * build date, and build time we could include version number, author and
 * last change date by having macros in every .c file's beginning.
 *
 * Note that under C++, higher levels of debugging information can use the
 * constructor/destructor facilities of C++ code to create automatic
 * dependency information for files and all kinds of other useful facilities
 * if the source-code control system above can be extended for most file types.
 *
 * Because this file controls compile-time debugging detail, it is intended
 * for instances where source distribution is not desirable. The ability to
 * include multiple library versions is an invaluable aid to debugging, not
 * merely because of the extra information that may be provided in case of a
 * simply detected error, but because the addition of debugging information
 * subtly alters the characteristics of the system under test. Merely
 * including a range of different libraries can test a system for a variety
 * of the more subtle bugs that usually manifest themselves only during the
 * porting process.
 */

/*
 * We define standard names for system debugging-level macros that are
 * controlled by a single user symbol defined on the command line for the
 * compilation, _DEBUG_LEVEL. If not defined, this symbol defaults to the
 * value zero. The value of this symbol determines the level of detail
 * included in the compile-time debugging information, and/or the level of
 * run-time checking that is desired.
 *
 * This facility defines a simple linear scale of debugging detail, and is
 * intended to supplement system-dependent optional debugging facilities in
 * cases where the systems affected by a problem cannot be easily determined
 * without experimentation.

/*
 * The "standard" debugging macro __FILE_INFO__ can be used in place of the
 * more common __FILE__ definition in many cases. At different levels of
 * debugging information, the value of this symbol (which is an ANSI string)
 * includes more information. At debugging level 0, this macro expands to
 * an empty string, allowing it to be used without complex #if statements
 * in the client.
 *
 * A side issue is the way spaces are included in the output string; note
 * that individual feature tests are done in bit order of the feature
 * string, so we can do some funky tests of the magnitude of part of the
 * feature mask to see if anything we are interested in is following the
 * current bit. Sleazy, but it gives nice output.
 *
 * Because including line numbers as strings generates a lot of big strings
 * that cannot be merged, we provide __FILE_INFO__, which consists of a string
 * and an optional line number (zero if line numbers are not to be included),
 * and __FILE_INFO_STRING__, which is a single string.
 *
 * We also export the symbol __NO_FILE_INFO__ if we know that the value of
 * __FILE_INFO__ is an empty string, in order to allow users to replace a
 * null string expansion with a NULL value.
