/*
 * This header defines constants and structures related to the BSD-
 * derived getrlimit () and setrlimit (), which are supported in System V,
 * Release 4. The BSD function getrusage () is not part of SVR4.
 *
 * The mere presence of this header should satisfy BSD-derived code that
 * includes it.  We define the SVR4 ABI-specified contents for this header
 * below, but guarded by a feature-test as some configuration code may test
 * for the presence of symbols defined in this header as a way of identifying
 * support for getrlimit ().
 *
 * Note that getrlimit () is not part of iBCS2, and is therefore not supported
 * in COHERENT 4.x.
