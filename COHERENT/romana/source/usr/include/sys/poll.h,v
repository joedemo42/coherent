 * The contents of the "pollhead" structure used in System V polling are not

 * The "pollhead" structure is intended to be totally opaque. Instances must
 * be allocated and freed with the functions given, and no access to the
 * internal structure of this item is permissible.
 *
 * It is worthwhile for implementations to note several facts about System V
 * polling, however; consider the extra difficulties involved in preventing
 * race conditions in polling when the system is multithreaded. The chpoll ()
 * entry point is required to never sleep, or call a function such that it
 * might sleep (which means that calling "phalloc (KM_SLEEP)" is not permitted
 * in that context), implying that an implementation may hold a basic lock to
 * limit race conditions. Essentially, implementations should spend as little
 * time as possible in the chpoll () entry point.
