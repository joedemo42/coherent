aaccttvvssiigg() -- Signal-Handler Routine

aaccttvvssiigg()

The routine aaccttvvssiigg() activates a signal handler.  For example:

    if (SELF->p_ssig && nondsig())
        actvsig();

If the  current process has received a signal  (pp_ssssiigg being non-zero) that
is  not  ignored  (not default  signal  handling),  calling aaccttvvssiigg()  will
activate  it.   ``Activate''  means that  the  process  is  moved from  the
kernel's  ``suspended'' list  to its  ``ready'' list,  where it  will await
further execution  by the  kernel.  If  the current process  is terminated,
aaccttvvssiigg() will not return.
