SSCCSSII -- Device Driver


The  COHERENT SCSI  series of  device drivers  lets you  use SCSI-interface
devices attached to host adapters from several vendors.

All COHERENT  SCSI device  drivers use major  number 13, thus  allowing all
SCSI  devices  to  be  accessed  via  standard  device-naming  conventions.
Peripherals can be  accessed as either block- or character-special devices.
The minor  number specifies the  device and partition  number for disk-type
devices; this  allows the use of up to  eight SCSI identifiers (SCSI-ID's),
with up  to four  logical unit  numbers (LUNs) per  SCSI-ID and up  to four
partitions per LUN.  Tape and other special devices decode the minor number
to perform special operations such as ``rewind on close'' or ``no rewind on
close''.

The  first  ooppeenn call  on  a  SCSI disk  device  allocates  memory for  the
partition table and reads it into memory.

See  the release  notes for  further  information regarding  supported host
adapters and peripherals.
