BBuuiilldd -- Command

/uussrr/ssyyss/BBuuiilldd _o_p_t_i_o_n__l_i_s_t

The script  /uussrr/ssyyss/BBuuiilldd builds a new COHERENT  kernel.  Its many options
allow you to choose the mix  of devices to linked into the new kernel.  The
following describes these options in detail.

aall, aassyy, hhss
          The default  device driver for  async devices is  aassyy. You _c_a_n_n_o_t
          combine  this device  with either of  the older  (i.e., obsolete)
          drivers aall or  hhss. However, aall and hhss may  both be present in the
          same kernel.  If you include aall or hhss, you must create the proper
          device nodes in directory /ddeevv.

aahhaa, aatt, ssss
          The default driver is aatt only, for a system with an AT-type (MFM,
          RLL, ESDI,  or IDE)  hard drive.   You can use  any one  of these
          devices in  a configuration, and  you can use  aatt and one  of the
          SCSI  devices in  the same  kernel.  You  cannot patch  both SCSI
          devices, aahhaa and ssss, into the same kernel.

kkbb, kkbb_dd, kkbb_ff, nnkkbb
          You can  use only  one of  these keyboard drivers.   nnkkbb supports
          keyboard tables,  which you  can load  with the commands  kept in
          directory  /ccoonnff/kkbbdd). It  uses scan-code set  3, which  does not
          work on about 5% of the cheap clone keyboards.

          Driver kkbb  works on  all keyboards,  but does not  allow loadable
          keyboard  configuration and is  therefore for  U.S.-style systems
          only.

          Drivers kkbb_dd  and kkbb_ff are,  respectively, the German  and French
          variants of the kkbb driver.

vvtt        Use this option to support virtual consoles.  Because this driver
          uses  an  extension  of the  nnkkbb  keyboard  driver,  none of  the
          previous  keyboard  drivers should  be  specified,  and the  same
          keyboard restrictions apply to vvtt as to nnkkbb above.

vvttkkbb, vvttkkbb_dd, vvttkkbb_ff
          You  can use  only one  of these  keyboard drivers.   Driver vvttkkbb
          works  on all  keyboards, but  does  not allow  loadable keyboard
          configuration and is therefore for U.S.-style systems only.

          Drivers  vvttkkbb_dd  and vvttkkbb_ff  are,  respectively,  the German  and
          French variants of the vvttkkbb driver.

-aa _a_s_y_n_c-_f_i_l_e
          If you use device driver aassyy,  this option lets you supply a file
          other  than  /eettcc/ddeeffaauulltt/aassyynncc  as  the  option to  the  command
          aassyyppaattcchh.

-cc _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r-_f_l_a_g_s
          This option lets you pass compiler flags directly to mmaakkee.

-iipp       This option tells BBuuiilldd to repeat  the same set of patches on the
          new  kernel that  you patched  into the  present kernel  when you
          installed COHERENT  on your system,  before it patches  in any of
          the requests you are making now.

-oo _k_e_r_n_e_l-_f_i_l_e:
          Name the kernel file to be  created.  If you are booting from the
          hard  drive,  the  kernel  file  must  be  located  in  the  root
          directory.

_X=_Y       If  an option  string  contains an  equal sign,  BBuuiilldd passes  it
          directly as an argument  to command ppaattcchh, which is applied after
          the kernel is built.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s
For example, an invocation of:

    Build at nkb

builds  a  COHERENT  kernel using  the  aatt  device  driver  for the  AT/IDE
interface hard disk, using device driver nnkkbb which is the user configurable
keyboard device driver.

An alternate configuration could be:

    Build -ip ss kb

which builds a  COHERENT kernel using the ssss device  driver for the Seagate
and Future Domain SCSI interface hard disk, using device driver kkbb which is
the traditional COHERENT  keyboard device driver.  The kernel file produced
will be  patched the same as  the current kernel on  the host system.  _N_o_t_e
