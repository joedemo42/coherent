ttnn -- Device Driver


/ddeevv/ttnn* provides  access to an  ARCNET local area  network via a  Tiac 236
card,  Tiac 238  card or  equivalent (e.g., Pure  Data ARCNET  card).  Each
entry  is  assigned major  device  number  20, and  may  be  accessed as  a
character-special device.

The ttnn driver supports up to four ARCNET cards in a single computer.  Minor
devices 0, 1, 2, and 3 refer to each card.  For a card to work properly, it
must  have a  unique interrupt,  64-kilobyte memory  bank, and  port number
assigned to it.  The driver must  also be configured to the same interrupt,
memory bank, and port number.  You can use the command /ccoonnff/ppaattcchh to build
a properly configured version of the kernel; see the Lexicon article hhss for
sample  commands.   If  loadable  device  drivers  are  used  they  may  be
configured in the identical fashion.

For an interface  to be accessible from the COHERENT  system, a device file
must  be present  in directory  /ddeevv with the  appropriate type,  major and
minor device  numbers, and permissions.   You can use the  command mmkknnoodd to
creates a special file for a device, as follows:

/eettcc/mmkknnoodd /ddeevv/ttnn00  cc 2200   00
/eettcc/mmkknnoodd /ddeevv/ttnn11  cc 2200   11

It is  usual to have a  generic LAN interface /ddeevv/ttnn.   This is associated
with a particular LAN card by the following command:

/bbiinn/llnn -ff /ddeevv/ttnn00  /ddeevv/ttnn

This device  driver provides  a raw interface  to the LAN.   To communicate
with other computers  on the network, it is normally  necessary to add some
higher level protocol (e.g., XNS or TCP/IP).
