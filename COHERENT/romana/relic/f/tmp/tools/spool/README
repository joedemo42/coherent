Hi Bob,

To make the executables, run make.  The makefile should build them.

To put everything where it needs to go, run MK.  This script moves MLP
things into the correct area of the disk and BUILDS an installable 
diskette. (You can turn this feature off).

You can edit the manual pages in "man," and when you run MK, they
will be nroffed and put into their place with the other man pages.

MLP.post is the Installation disk's init script.

Be sure to keep a backup copy of the file "controls."  It has a bad habit
of disapearing when you are playing with the source.  Also, I will be truncated
if it is accessed by any MLP programs that do not have the correct perms &
ownships.  (I've tried to work this kink out, but I've not yet succeeded.)


Sorry things are not as neat as they could be--I had intended to cleanup
things a bit before I passed the source onto MWC.  I've received the 3.5"
Coherent, but I do not have a machine as yet.

Thanks,  --Brett
