Summarize login accounting information

One of the accounting mechanisms available on the COHERENT system
is  login accounting,  which keeps  track of  the time  each user
spends logged  into the system.   Login accounting is  enabled by
creating the file  /usr/adm/wtmp.  Thereafter, the routines date,
login,  and init  write raw accounting  data to  /usr/adm/wtmp to
record the  time, the name of  the terminal, and the  name of the
user for each date change, login, logout, or system reboot.

The command  ac summarizes the raw  accounting data.  By default,
ac  prints the  total connect time  found in  /usr/adm/wtmp.  Any
username restricts the summary to each specified user.

The following options are available:

-dd    Itemize  the  output  into  daily  (midnight  to  midnight)
     periods.

-pp   Print individual totals.

-ww   Use wfile rather than /usr/adm/wtmp as the raw data file.

***** Notes *****

The  file  /usr/adm/wtmp can  become  very  large; therefore,  it
should be  truncated periodically.  Special care  should be taken
if login accounting is enabled  on a COHERENT system with a small
disk.
