Reboot the COHERENT system

rreebboooott [ -pp ]

reboot reboots  the COHERENT system.   The option -p  prompts the
user if he really wishes to reboot before executing the reboot.

reboot can be run only by the superuser.

The COHERENT system  should be rebooted only while in single-user
mode.   Failure to  return to  single-user mode  before rebooting
could damage the COHERENT file system and destroy data.
