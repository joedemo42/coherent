Terminal initialization

/eettcc/ggeettttyy _t_y_p_e

The initialization  process init invokes getty  for each terminal
indicated in the file /etc/ttys.  getty tries to read a user name
from the terminal which  is the standard input, adapting its mode
settings  accordingly.  Then  getty invokes  login with  the name
read.  This  process may  set delays,  mapping of upper  to lower
case,  speed, and  whether  the terminal  normally uses  carriage
return or linefeed to terminate input.

If the terminal baud rate  is wrong, the login message printed by
getty will appear garbled.  If the specified type indicates vari-
able speeds, as described  below, hitting BREAK will try the next
speed.

init passes  the third character in a line  of the file /etc/ttys
as the  type argument to  getty.  type conveys  information about
the  terminal port.   An upper-case  letter in the  range A  to S
specifies a hard-wired baud rate, as indicated in the header file
<sgtty.h>.  Other  characters specify a range  of speeds suitable
to a  dial-in modem.   The following variable-speed  settings are
recognized:

00  Cycles  through speeds 300,  1200, 150, and 110  baud, in that
   order.  This is a good default setting for dial-in ports.

-  Teletype model 33, fixed at 110 baud.

11  Teletype model 37, fixed at 150 baud.

22  9600 baud with delays (e.g., Tektronix 4104).

33  Cycles  between 2400, 1200,  and 300 baud.  This  is used with
   2400-bps modems.

44  DECwriter (LA36) with delays.

55  Like 3, but starts at 300 baud.

getty  recognizes the following  fixed-speed settings,  for hard-
wired terminals:

        AA       50 baud
        BB       75 baud
        CC       110 baud
        DD       134 baud
        EE       150 baud
        FF       200 baud
        GG       300 baud
        HH       600 baud
        II       1200 baud
        JJ       1800 baud
