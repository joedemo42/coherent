Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer spooler daemon

/usr/lib/hpd

hpd is  a daemon program  that runs in the  background and prints
listings queued by the  hhpprr command.  hhppdd is run automatically by
hhpprr.  If there is no printing  to do, or if another daemon is al-
ready  running  (indicated  by  the  ddppiidd  file), hhppdd  exits  im-
mediately.  Otherwise,  it searches the spool  directory for con-
trol files of listings to print.  These control files contain the
names of  files to print, the user name,  banner pages, and files
to be removed upon completion.

hpd does not print listings in any particular order.  There is no
prioritization of printing, either by size or by requester.

The hhppsskkiipp command  terminates or restarts the current hp printer
listing.
