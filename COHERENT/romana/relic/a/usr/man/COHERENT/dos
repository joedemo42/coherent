Transfer files to/from an MS-DOS file system

ddooss [-]ddFFllrrttxx[_f_l_a_g_s] [_d_e_v_i_c_e] [_f_i_l_e ...]

The command ddooss allows  the COHERENT user to manipulate an MS-DOS
file  system, which  may  be either  a hard-disk  partition or  a
floppy disk.  It can build an empty MS-DOS file system, label it,
list the files in it,  transfer files between it and COHERENT, or
delete files from it.

The given _d_e_v_i_c_e must be  a special file that specifies an MS-DOS
file  system, such  as floppy-disk  drive /ddeevv/ffhhaa00  or hard-disk
partition /ddeevv/aatt00aa.   The default _d_e_v_i_c_e is  /ddeevv/ddooss, which the
system administrator should link to the most commonly used device
name.

ddooss  converts  between  the  differing file-name  conventions  of
COHERENT and MS-DOS.  An MS-DOS _f_i_l_e argument may be specified in
lower or upper case,  using `/' as the path-name separator.  When
transferring files  from MS-DOS to COHERENT,  ddooss converts an MS-
DOS file name to a COHERENT file name in lower case only.  If the
MS-DOS file  name contains no  extension, the COHERENT  file name
contains no  `.'.  When transferring  files from COHERENT  to MS-
DOS, ddooss  converts all alphabetic  characters in a  COHERENT file
name to upper  case; if a period `.' appears  at the beginning or
end of  a file name, ddooss  converts it to `_'.   ddooss truncates the
part of the  file name before the last `.'  to a maximum of eight
characters  and truncates  the extension  to  a maximum  of three
characters.

The  command  line  must specify  exactly  one  of the  following
_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s.

dd    Delete each  _f_i_l_e from the MS-DOS  file system.  This option
     also allows the user to delete empty directories.

FF    Create an empty  MS-DOS file system on a formatted diskette.
     This option is  analogous to the COHERENT command /eettcc/mmkkffss.
     The COHERENT commands /eettcc/ffddffoorrmmaatt and /eettcc/mmkkffss initialize
     a COHERENT diskette in two steps.  The MS-DOS command ffoorrmmaatt
     initializes  an  MS-DOS  diskette  by  performing  both  the
     physical and logical formatting operations with one command.
     To  initialize an  MS-DOS diskette  under COHERENT,  use the
     command /eettcc/ffddffoorrmmaatt -vv _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e, followed by the command
     ddooss FF  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e.  If _f_i_l_e  is named, ddooss copies  it to the
     boot block of the file system.  The ddooss command cannot build
     a file system on a hard-disk partition.

ll    Label the MS-DOS file system.  The command line must specify
     exactly one _f_i_l_e argument, which gives the label.

rr    Replace  each  _f_i_l_e  on  the  MS-DOS  file system  with  the
     COHERENT file  of the same  name.  If a  given _f_i_l_e argument
     specifies   a   COHERENT   directory,   ddooss   replaces   its

     subdirectories recursively to  the MS-DOS file system unless
     the ss flag is used.  If no _f_i_l_e is specified, ddooss copies all
     files in the current directory to the MS-DOS file system.

tt    List  the  files on  the  MS-DOS file  system.   If no  _f_i_l_e
     argument is given,  ddooss lists the entire MS-DOS file system;
     otherwise, it lists each _f_i_l_e.  If a _f_i_l_e argument specifies
     an MS-DOS  subdirectory, ddooss lists its  contents.  ddooss lists
     directories first in alphabetical order, then ordinary files
     in alphabetical order.

xx    Extract each _f_i_l_e from  the MS-DOS file system to a COHERENT
     file of  the same name.  If a  given _f_i_l_e argument specifies
     an   MS-DOS   subdirectory,   ddooss  extracts   its   contents
     recursively unless the ss flag is used.  If no _f_i_l_e is given,
     ddooss extracts  all files from  the MS-DOS file  system to the
     current COHERENT directory.

The following _f_l_a_g_s are available.

aa    Perform  ASCII newline  conversion on  file  transfer.  When
     moving files  from COHERENT to MS-DOS,  this option converts
     each COHERENT newline character `\n' (ASCII LLFF) to an MS-DOS
     end-of-line (ASCII CCRR and LLFF); when moving files from MS-DOS
     to COHERENT, it does the opposite.  By default, ddooss performs
     binary file transfer, without newline conversion.

kk    Keep  the  file modification  time  (mtime)  on extract  and
     replace  operations.   By default,  ddooss  gives extracted  or
     replaced  files the  current  time.  With  this option,  ddooss
     gives the  extracted or replaced  file the same  time as the
     original file.

nn    List files  in order of  creation (newest file  last) rather
     than in alphabetical order.  This option applies only to the
     table-of-contents  function.  ddooss  always lists  directories
     before files, with or without the nn option.

pp    Perform a  piped extract or replace  (for use in pipelines).
     The  command line  must specify  exactly one  _f_i_l_e argument.
     For extract,  ddooss reads the given _f_i_l_e and  writes it to the
     standard output.  For  replace, ddooss reads the standard input
     and writes it to the given _f_i_l_e.

ss    Suppress  extraction or  replacement of  subdirectories.  By
     default,   ddooss    extracts   or    replaces   subdirectories
     recursively.

vv    Verbose option.   Provide additional information  about each
     function performed.

[11-99]
     A digit specifies a  logical drive number on an extended MS-
     DOS  partition.  For  example, ddooss  ttvv22 /ddeevv/aatt00cc  lists the
     directory  of the  second logical  drive on  extended MS-DOS

     partition /ddeevv/aatt00cc.

***** Examples *****

The first example copies all files located in directories ssoouurrcceess
and  iinncclluuddee, as  well as any  subdirectories, from  floppy drive
/ddeevv/ffvvaa11 to correspondingly  named subdirectories in the current
COHERENT directory:


        dos xavk /dev/fva1 sources include


Note that ffvvaa11 is a high-density, 3.5-inch floppy disk in floppy-
disk drive  1 (a.k.a., drive B:).  The files  will be copied with
ASCII newline  conversion and will retain the  time and date that
they had under MS-DOS.

The next  example copies a file from an  MS-DOS partition on your
hard disk.   Suppose that CC:  is the primary  MS-DOS partition on
your  first  hard  drive.   The  following  command  copies  file
CC:\AAUUTTOOEEXXEECC.BBAATT to /aauuttooeexxeecc.bbaatt in your COHERENT root partition:


        dos xa /dev/at0a /autoexec.bat


You will want to use the aa switch any time you are transferring a
text file.

Suppose  that  the  second partition  on  your  first hard  drive
(COHERENT device /ddeevv/aatt00bb)  is an extended MS-DOS partition with
two  logical drives,  DD: and  EE:.  To copy  a COHERENT  text file
/ttmmpp/ffoooo to DD:\TTMMPP\FFOOOO, use the command


        dos ra1 /dev/at0b /tmp/foo


To copy non-text file  ffrroottzz in the current COHERENT directory to
MS-DOS file EE:\DDBBFF\AAXX\FFRROOTTZZ, use the command


        dos rp2 /dev/at0b dbf/ax/frotz < frotz

***** Notes *****

ddooss does  not work with  MS-DOS hard-disk file  systems that hold
more  than  64,000 clusters  (i.e.,  with  four-byte FAT  entries
rather  than   1.5-byte  or  two-byte  FAT   entries).   It  does

understand MS-DOS  3.3 extended  disk partitions (where  a single
partition  contains more  than one MS-DOS  file system),  but you
must know whether  a partition contains a normal MS-DOS partition
or an extended partition.

ddooss does not check for unusual characters in a COHERENT file name
or for file names that differ from other file names only in case.
