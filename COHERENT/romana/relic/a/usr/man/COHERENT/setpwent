The  COHERENT  system  has five  routines  that  search the  file
/etc/passwd, which  contains information about every  user of the
system.  The  returned structure passwd is  defined in the header
file pwd.h, as follows:


struct passwd {
     char *pw_name; /* login user name */
     char *pw_passwd;/* login password */
     int  pw_uid;   /* login user id */
     int  pw_gid;   /* login group id */
     int  pw_quota; /* file quota (unused) */
     char *pw_comment;/* comments (unused) */
     char *pw_gecos;/* (unused) */
     char *pw_dir;  /* working directory */
     char *pw_shell;/* initial program */
};


For detailed descriptions of  the above fields, see the entry for
passwd.

setpwent  rewinds the  password  file, which  allows searches  to
begin from the beginning of the file.
