sticky bit                  Definition                 sticky bit




The sticky  bit is one of  the mode bits associated  with a file.
If the sticky  bit is set for an executable  file and swapping is
enabled, COHERENT behaves in  a special way when it executes that
file.

When the  COHERENT system executes  the file the  first time, all
proceeds  normally.  When  the program  exits, however,  the pure
segments are left on the  swap device; when the program is re-in-
voked, COHERENT  reads ``pure'' code  (text) areas from  the swap
device  and all  other (impure)  segments  from the  file system.
This speeds  execution of large  programs that are  executed fre-
quently.

This strategy works well on systems that have large swap devices.
Because overuse  of the sticky  bit would quickly  swamp the swap
device, only the superuser can set the sticky bit.
