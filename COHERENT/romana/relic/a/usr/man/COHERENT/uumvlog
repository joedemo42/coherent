Examine UUCP operations

uuuummvvlloogg _d_a_y_s

uumvlog copies  all UUCP log  files into backup  files, named for
their respective commands and  the date upon which the backup was
performed.  days gives the  number of days for which backup files
should be kept: if a backup file is more than days days old, then
uumvlog will delete it.

This command  should be run  by cron, because the  UUCP log files
can threaten  to exhaust available  file space on  a small system
unless they are chopped back  daily.  For directions on how to do
this, see the tutorial for UUCP or the Lexicon entry for ccrroonn.
