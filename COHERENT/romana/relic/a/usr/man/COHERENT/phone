Print numbers and addresses from phone directory

pphhoonnee _p_e_r_s_o_n ...

The command phone  searches a number of telephone directory files
for each  person argument that is given.   Any lines that matches
any of  the person arguments  is printed.  Typically,  such lines
contain the  telephone number, name,  and address of  a person or
organization.   Lower-case letters  in person  can be  matched by
both the  same letter and the  corresponding upper-case letter in
the phone directory.

The user  may supply his own phone directory  by setting the (ex-
ported) shell  variable PHONEBOOK, to the name  of that file.  If
given, this file  is searched first.  Then, the system-wide phone
book is always searched.
