basename  strips  its  argument  file  of any  leading  directory
prefixes.  If  the result contains the  optional suffix, basename
also strips it.  basename  prints the result on the standard out-
put.

For example, the command


        basename /usr/fred/source.c


returns


        source.c


basename is  most useful  when it is  used with other  shell com-
mands.  For example, the command


        for i in *.c
        do
                cp $i `basename $i .c`.backup
        done


copies  every file  that has  the suffix  .cc into  an identically
named file that has the suffix .bbaacckkuupp.
