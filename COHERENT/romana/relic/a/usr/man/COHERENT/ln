ln                           Command                           ln




Create a link to a file

llnn [-ff] _o_l_d_f_i_l_e [_n_e_w_f_i_l_e]
llnn [-ff] _o_l_d_f_i_l_e ... _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

A link lets  you give you a file more  than one name.  The file's
contents or attributes may be changed via either name.

In its first form, ln links  the name newfile to the file that is
already named oldfile, provided that newfile does not already ex-
ist.  If  newfile is  omitted, a link  is created in  the current
directory with the same file name as oldfile, with leading direc-
tory information removed.

In the  second form, ln  links oldfile with an  identical name in
another  directory.  In  effect, one  file  will ``live''  in two
directories.

If newfile  already exists, -f forces ln to  unlink it and assign
its name to oldfile.

Links to directories or across file systems are impossible.
