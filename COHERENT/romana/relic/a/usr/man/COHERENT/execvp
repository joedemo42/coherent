The COHERENT  system includes six functions  that allow a process
to execute another  executable file (or load module, as described
in the header  l.out.h).  execvp specifies arguments as a single,
NULL-terminated  array of  parameters, called  argv.   Unlike the
related call execv, execvp searches for file in all of the direc-
tories named in the environmental variable PATH.  For more infor-
mation on program execution, see execution.

such as file  being nonexistent, not accessible with execute per-
mission, having a bad format, or too large to fit in memory.
