The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.  The  function msqrt
sets the multiple-precision integer  (or mmiinntt) pointed to by b to
the  integral portion  of the  positive square  root of  the mmiinntt
pointed  to by  a.   It sets  the  mmiinntt pointed  to by  r to  the
remainder.  The value pointed to  by a must not be negative.  The
result of the operation is defined by the condition


             _a = _b * _b + _r.
