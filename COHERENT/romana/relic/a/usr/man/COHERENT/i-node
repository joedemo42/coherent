COHERENT system file identifier


Each file  on a  COHERENT file system  is identified by  a unique
number, called  an i-node number  or i-number.  Each  i-node con-
tains information about a  file: its mode, link count, user iden-
tifier, group identifier,  size, location on the file system, ac-
cess time, modify time, and creation time.

The user refers to a file  by a file name, stored in a directory;
the directory entry identifies  the file by its i-node number.  A
device and  i-node number together uniquely  specify a file.  The
headers ino.h and i-node.h define, respectively, disk i-nodes and
memory i-nodes.
