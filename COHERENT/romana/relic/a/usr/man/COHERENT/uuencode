Encode a binary file for transmission to a remote system

uuencode prepares a binary file for transmission to a remote des-
tination via  uucp.  uuencode takes binary  input and produces an
encoded  version, consisting  of printable  ASCII  characters, on
standard output,  which may be  redirected or piped  to uucp.  If
source is not specified, the standard input is read.

The format of the encoded file is as follows:

1. A header line starting with the characters begin followed by a
   space.  This is followed by the mode of the file in octal (see
   chmod for  details) and the name of  the output file specified
   on the command line.  These last two fields are also separated
   by a  space.  The mode and  the system name can  be changed by
   directing the output into a file and editing it.

2. The body of the file, consisting of a number of lines, each no
   more than  62 characters long, including  a newline character.
   Each line  starts with a  character count written  as a single
   ASCII character,  representing an integer value  from 0 (octal
   40) to  63 (octal 135) giving the number  of characters in the
   rest of the line.   This is followed by the encoded characters
   and a newline.  The last line of the body is a line consisting
   of an ASCII space (octal 40).

3. The trailer line has just  the characters end on a line by it-
   self.

The encoding  is done by  taking three bytes and  storing them in
four characters, six bits per character.

***** Example *****

To encode the file tmp consisting of the line


        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.


to be sent to the remote system george, enter:


        uuencode tmp sys


The output will be:

        end


Note  that the  third  line consists  of  a space  followed by  a
newline.

***** Notes *****

The file  is expanded by  more than one  third, causing increased
transmission  time.  This  can  be a  factor  when sending  large
files.
