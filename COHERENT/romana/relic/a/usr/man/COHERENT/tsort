Topological sort

ttssoorrtt [_f_i_l_e]

tsort performs  a topological sort of a set  of input items.  The
input file (or the standard input, if no file is given) specifies
an ordering  on pairs  of items.  It  consists of pairs  of items
separated by  blanks, tabs or  newlines.  If a  pair contains the
same item twice, it simply indicates  that the item is in the in-
put  set.  Otherwise,  the  pair indicates  that  the first  item
precedes the second in the ordering.

tsort prints  a sorted  list of the  input items on  the standard
output.

tsort prints an error message  on the standard error if its input
contains an odd number of  items or if the specified ordering in-
cludes a cycle.
