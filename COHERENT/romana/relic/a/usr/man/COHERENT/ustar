uussttaarr  reads  and  writes  archive  files  that  conform  to  the
Archive/Interchange  File  Format   specified  in  IEEE  Standard
1003.1-1988.

***** Options *****

uussttaarr recognizes the following command-line options:

-cc   Create  a  new  archive.  Write  each  _f_i_l_e  into the  newly
     created archive

-rr   Append each _f_i_l_e to the end of the archive.

-tt   Display a directory (table of contents) of the archive.

-xx   Extract  each _f_i_l_e  from  the archive.   If  _f_i_l_e matches  a
     directory whose contents  had been written onto the archive,
     extract that directory  recursively.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist
     on the  system, uussttaarr creates  it with the same  mode as the
     one  in the  archive, except that  the set-user-id  and get-
     group-id  modes  are not  set  unless  you have  appropriate
     privileges.

     If _f_i_l_e  exists, uussttaarr does not change  file modes except as
     described above.  It  restores the owner, the group, and the
     modification time if possible.

     If the command line does not name a _f_i_l_e, uussttaarr extracts the
     entire contents of  the archive.  Note that if several files
     with  the  same  name  are  in  the archive,  the  last  one
     overwrites all earlier ones.

-ff   Use the next argument on the command line as the name of the
     archive instead  of the default, which  is standard input or
     standard  output, whichever is  appropriate for  the options
     given.  Thus,  you can use uussttaarr in a  pipe.  If you specify
     `-'  as the  archive  name with  option -ff,  uussttaarr uses  the
     default input and output streams.

-ll   Order uussttaarr to report if  it cannot resolve all of the links
     to the  files being  archived.  If  -ll is not  specified, no
     error  messages are  written to  the standard  output.  This
     modifier is valid only with the -cc or -rr options.

-mm   Do not restore  the modification times; set the modification
     time of  the file to the time  of extraction.  This modifier
     is invalid with the -tt option.

-oo   Give extracted files your user and group identifiers, rather
     than those on the archive.  This modifier is only valid with
     the -xx option.

-vv   Verbose operation.  With  this option, uussttaarr prints the name
     of each  file it processes,  preceded by the  option letter.
     With the  -tt option, the -vv option tells  uussttaarr to give more
     information  about  the archive's  entries  than just  their
     names.

-ww   Print the action to be taken  and the name of the file, then
     wait for  your confirmation.  If  you type a  word beginning
     with `y', uussttaarr  performs the action.  Any other input means
     ``no''.  This modifier is invalid with the -tt option.
