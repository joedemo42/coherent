wall                         Command                         wall




Send a message to all logged in users

/eettcc/wwaallll

wall  types a  message to  every user  currently logged  into the
COHERENT system,  with the  exception of  the sender.  It  can be
used to inform users  of information of general interest; for ex-
ample, that  man has landed  on the moon,  or that the  system is
going down in 15 minutes.

wall reads  the message to  be broadcast from  the standard input
until end  of file.   When it sends  the message, it  prefaces it
with  the herald  ``Broadcast  message ...'',  which includes  an
audible warning.  Only  the superuser should invoke /etc/wall (to
override access protections of the target terminals).
