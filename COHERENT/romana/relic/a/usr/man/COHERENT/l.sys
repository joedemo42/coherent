Format for UUCP site descriptions

/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/LL.ssyyss

The  file  LL.ssyyss  holds descriptions  of  remote  sites that  are
accessed  via  UUCP.   UUCP utilities  read  from  this file  the
description  of any  system  that you  ask them  to access.   The
superuser rroooott can read and  edit the contents of this file, both
to update its contents and to add new descriptions.

Each line in LL.ssyyss is either  a comment or a site descriptor.  If
a  line  begins  with  a  pound  sign (`#'),  it  is  a  comment;
otherwise,  it  is  treated  as  a  site descriptor.   Each  site
description  consists of  five or more  fields, each  field being
demarcated by one or more white-space characters.

***** Site Description *****

The first five fields of a site description identify the site and
how to contact it.  These fields are as follows:

11. RReemmoottee ssyysstteemm nnaammee
     This names  the remote  system.  In COHERENT  versions 3.0.0
     and 3.1.0, only the first seven characters are significant.

22. LLeeggaall ccaallll ttiimmeess
     This  entry specifies  when the remote  site may  be called.
     There are several possible formats:

             NNeevveerr
             _d_a_y__l_i_s_t
             _d_a_y__a_n_d__t_i_m_e__l_i_s_t

     NNeevveerr  means never  call the  remote site;  use it  only for
     sites that will only be calling you.  _d_a_y__l_i_s_t may be any of
     the  following: AAnnyy  (that is,  call  as soon  as a  file is
     queued for sending),  WWkk (for Monday through Friday), or one
     or  more of  SSuu, MMoo,  TTuu, WWee,  TThh, FFrr,  or SSaa,  separated by
     commas   (be   sure    not   to   use   spaces   here).    A
     _d_a_y__a_n_d__t_i_m_e__l_i_s_t is  identical to a _d_a_y__l_i_s_t  but appends a
     _t_i_m_e field  to one or more of the  days specified.  The _t_i_m_e
     field consists of  two four-digit 24-hour times separated by
     a hyphen.  The  legal call time is any time  at or after the
     first time  and at or before the second  time.  If the first
     time is greater than the second time, then the valid calling
     times will be from midnight  to the second time and from the
     first  time  through  midnight.   Omitting  the  _t_i_m_e  field
     permits  calling at  any  time on  the  specified day.   For
     example:

             # never dial the site
             Never
             # dial the site whenever a file is queued
             Any

             Wk1300-1900,Sa
             # Midnight Sunday through 2 AM and 11 PM through midnight
             Su2300-0200


33. DDeevviiccee
     This indicates the device on your computer via which UUCP is
     to contact the remote site.  For sites accessed via a modem,
     use the entry AACCUU. For sites directly connected via a serial
     port, use the name of the port, e.g.,  ccoomm33ll.

4. SSppeeeedd
     This gives  the the baud rate  at which UUCP is  to call the
     remote system,  e.g., 1200, 2400, or  9600.  This speed must
     be valid  according to the  file /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp for  at least
     one modem described in the file LL-ddeevviicceess.

55. TTeelleepphhoonnee nnuummbbeerr
     This gives the  string that UUCP is to send  to the modem in
     order  to call  the remote  site.   This string  may include
     special characters for  your modem (e.g., some modems accept
     a  comma if  a  pause is  needed during  dialing), but  will
     usually be simply the number to dial, e.g.  ``17085590412''.
     The string  that is actually  sent to the  modem consists of
     the   ccss  and   ddss  strings  from   the  modem's   entry  in
     /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp, the telephone  number, and finally the ddee and
     ccee strings from /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp.

***** Chat Script *****

The remaining  fields in a  descriptor form the  ``chat script'',
that is, the dialogue that your UUCP system must perform in order
to log  on to the  remote computer.  The chat  script consists of
strings of characters to be exchanged between the remote computer
and your  UUCP system; first  comes an _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g  (the string
that your system  expects), followed by a _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g (the string
to send in response to the _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g).  When calling a remote
site, your  computer waits for  a carrier from  the remote modem,
then waits for the  first _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g, after which it sends the
first _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g, etc.

Consider,  for example,  the remote system  bbaazzooookkaa, which  has a
login  prompt  of  CCoohheerreenntt llooggiinn:;  assume  that  your login  is
hhoowwaarrdd, the  remote system prompts for  passwords with ppaasssswwoorrdd:,
and your  password is rr5566dd9922.   The chat script  for bbaazzooookkaa will
read as follows:

As  you can  see from  the above  example, an  _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g need
contain only  the last five characters of  what the remote system
sends.

An   _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g  may   be  compound   or  simple.    A  simple
_e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g is  either a sequence of  characters (not including
spaces, tabs,  or hyphens) or  a pair of quotation  marks "".  An
empty  pair of  quotation marks  tells UUCP not  to wait  for any
incoming  prompt, but  go  ahead and  send  the next  _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g
(i.e.,  expect a  null string).   A  compound _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g  is a
sequence of fields separated by hyphens, in the format:


        _s_i_m_p_l_e__e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g-_s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g-_s_i_m_p_l_e__e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g-_s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g...


A compound  _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g has  no spaces  or tabs.  If  the first
simple _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g is not received within 25 seconds, the first
_s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g after the hyphen is sent and the system waits for the
second simple  _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g; if the  second simple _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g
is not received after 25 seconds, the second _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g is sent,
and  so  on.   This syntax  allows  UUCP  to  use  any number  of
alternate expect/send  exchanges, rather than failing  if it does
not receive the first _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g.

A _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g  is the character  sequence that UUCP  sents to the
remote site.  Unless otherwise specified, UUCP sends a newline at
the end of any _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g.  As  a special case of this, an empty
alternate _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g tells UUCP  to send a single newline to the
remote site if  the preceding _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g is not received.  For
example


        ogin:--ogin:


is  a compound  _e_x_p_e_c_t__s_t_r_i_n_g  that tells  UUCP to  wait for  the
string ooggiinn: from the remote site.  If UUCP does not receive this
string within  the specified time  limit, it sends  a newline and
again waits for ooggiinn: from the remote site.

You  can  also   use  escape  sequences  to  embed  non-printable
characters in a _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g.  The following table lists all legal
escape sequences and their meaning:


      _N_o_t_a_t_i_o_n      _M_e_a_n_i_n_g

         \b         Send backspace
         \c         Suppress newline after _s_e_n_d__s_t_r_i_n_g
                    (Must appear at end of string)
         \d         Delay one second while sending

***** Limitations *****

LL.ssyyss has the following limitations:

->   Site descriptors may not continue beyond one line.

->   Line length cannot exceed 511 characters.

->   No line may have more than 27 composite-expect/send pairs.

->   In the COHERENT versions 3.0.0 and 3.1.0, there is no way to
     send a break signal  to the remote modem.  This feature will
     be added in a future release.

***** Example *****


The following  LL.ssyyss entries are  used to dial into  the MWC UUCP
BBS.  The  first entry corresponds to 2400  b.p.s. access and the
second  to 9600  b.p.s via a  Telebit Trailblazer  modem.  Please
note  that  in  the example  below,  entries  are continued  over
multiple  lines; in  the actual  file,  each entry  must be  on a
single line, but the line may exceed 80 characters in length.
