The COHERENT  system includes six functions  that allow a process
to execute another  executable file (or load module, as described
in the header l.out.h).   execle initializes the new stack of the
process to contain a  list of strings that are command arguments.
It specifies arguments individually, as a NULL-terminated list of
arg parameters.  The argument envp points to an array of pointers
to strings that  define file's environment.  For more information
on program execution and environments, see execution.

***** Diagnostics *****

execle does not return  if successful.  It returns -1 for errors,
such as file  being nonexistent, not accessible with execute per-
mission,  having a  bad format,  or being too  large to  fit into
memory.
