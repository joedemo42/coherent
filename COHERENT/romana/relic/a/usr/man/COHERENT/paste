Merge lines of files

ppaassttee [-ss] [-dd _l_i_s_t] _f_i_l_e ...

ppaassttee merges  corresponding lines from multiple  input files.  By
default, ppaassttee  uses the <ttaabb> character  to delineate texts from
different files.   ppaassttee writes the  the merged text  to standard
output; thus, ppaassttee can be used at the head of a shell pipeline.

If ppaassttee reads EOF from any  of the input files while other files
still contain data, it  substitutes blank lines as input from the
file that has ended.

***** Options *****

ppaassttee recognizes the following command-line options:

-dd _l_i_s_t
    Use  the characters  in _l_i_s_t to  separate the  output fields.
    The  characters  in  _l_i_s_t  are  taken  in sequence  and  used
    circularly, i.e.,  taken in  order until  the end of  _l_i_s_t is
    reached,  then  returning to  the  first  character in  _l_i_s_t.
    Normally,  ppaassttee uses  the <ttaabb>  character to  delineate the
    output  fields.   The   following  character  sequences  have
    special meaning when encountered in _l_i_s_t:

    \\      Output a single backslash character
    \tt      Output a <ttaabb> character
    \nn      Output a <nneewwlliinnee> character
    \00      Output a null string (i.e., no separator between output fields)


-ss  Output successive lines from each input _f_i_l_e across the page,
    with  each input  line  separated from  the next  by a  <ttaabb>
    character.  After all input lines from a given file have been
    concatenated,  terminate  the output  line  with a  <nneewwlliinnee>
    character and repeat the process on the next input file.

***** Example *****

The  following two  files will be  used for  subsequent examples.
FFiillee11 contains:


     File1_Line1
     File1_Line2
     File1_Line3
     File1_Line4


FFiillee22 contains:

paste                        Command                        paste



     File2_Line1
     File2_Line2
     File2_Line3
     File2_Line4


The command


     paste File1 File2


generates the following output:


     File1_Line1  File2_Line1
     File1_Line2  File2_Line2
     File1_Line3  File2_Line3
     File1_Line4  File2_Line4


Adding the option -ss yields the output:


     File1_Line1  File1_Line2 File1_Line3  File1_Line4
     File2_Line1  File2_Line2 File2_Line3  File2_Line4
