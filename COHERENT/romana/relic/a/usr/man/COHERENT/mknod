mknod is the COHERENT system call that creates a special file.  A
special  file is  one through  which a device  is accessed,  or a
named pipe.

mode gives the type of special file to be created.  It can be set
to IFBLK,  for a block-special device, such as  a disk driver; to
IFCHR,  for a  character-special  device, such  as a  serial-port
driver; or to IFPIPE, for a named pipe.

address  is  a  parameter interpreted  by  the  driver; it  might
specify  the channel  of a  multiplexor or the  unit number  of a
drive.  Note that this is not used with named pipes.
