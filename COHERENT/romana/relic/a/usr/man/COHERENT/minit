The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mint
helps to create a multiple-precision integer (or mmiinntt).  If a new
mint is  declared to be global or automatic,  you must call minit
before using  the variable.  This prevents  garbage values in the
newly  created mint  structure from causing  chaos.  A  mint con-
ditioned  by minit  has  no value;  however,  it may  be used  to
receive the result of an operation.
