SCSI device drivers


The COHERENT  SCSI series  of device  drivers lets you  use SCSI-
interface devices attached to host adapters from several vendors.

All  COHERENT  SCSI  device drivers  use  major  number 13,  thus
allowing  all SCSI  devices to be  accessed via  standard device-
naming conventions.  Peripherals can be accessed as either block-
or  character-special devices.   The minor  number  specifies the
device and  partition number  for disk-type devices;  this allows
the use  of up to eight SCSI identifiers  (SCSI-ID's), with up to
four  logical unit  numbers  (LUNs) per  SCSI-ID and  up to  four
partitions per  LUN.  Tape and  other special devices  decode the
minor number  to perform special  operations such as  ``rewind on
close'' or ``no rewind on close''.

The first  ooppeenn call on  a SCSI disk device  allocates memory for
the partition table and reads it into memory.

See the release notes for further information regarding supported
host adapters and peripherals.
