ccppiioo is  an archiving utility that reads and  writes files in the
format  specified  by the  ccppiioo  AArrcchhiivvee/IInntteerrcchhaannggee FFiillee  FFoorrmmaatt
specified in IEEE standard 1003.1-1988.

***** Options *****

ccppiioo recognizes the following command-line options:

-aa   Reset the  access times of input files  after they have been
     copied.  When  the -ll option  is also specified,  the linked
     files do  not have  their access  times reset.  Can  be used
     only with the -oo or -ii options.

-BB   Change the  size of a block.  Input/output  is to be blocked
     5,120 bytes  to the  record.  This  option can be  used only
     with  the -oo  or -ii  options, for data  directed to  or from
     character-special files.

-cc   Write   header   information   in   ASCII   characters   for
     portability.  Can be used only with the -ii or -oo options.

-dd   Creates directories as needed.  Can be used only with the -ii
     or -pp options.

-ff   Copy all files except  those in whose names match a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
     Can be used only with the -ii option.

-ii   In.   Read the  standard input,  which it  assumes to  be an
     archive that  had been created  with the -oo  option to ccppiioo.
     Copy  all  files  within the  archive  whose  names match  a
     _p_a_t_t_e_r_n into the current directory (default, all files).

-ll   Whenever possible, link files rather than copying them.  Can
     be used only with the -pp option.

-mm   Retain   previous  modification   times.   This   option  is
     ineffective on  directories that  are being copied.   Can be
     used only with the -ii or -pp options.

-oo   Out.  Copy  all files whose names  match a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (default,
     all files) into an archive written to standard output.

-pp   Pass mode.   This option causes ccppiioo  to read standard input
     for a  list of file names to  copy to destination _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.
     This  mode  of  operation  is  similar in  functionality  to
     command ccppddiirr, with  the added ability to specify individual
     file names via standard input.

-rr   Interactively rename  files.  Before it copies  a file, ccppiioo
     asks you  to rename  the file.   If you type  just <rreettuurrnn>,
     ccppiioo skips the file.  Should be  used only with the -ii or -oo
     options.

-tt   Print a  table of  contents of  an existing archive;  do not
     copy files  from the archive.  Can be used  only with the -ii
     option.

-uu   Copy files unconditionally.   Usually an older file will not
     replace a  new file  with the same  name.  Can be  used only
     with the -ii or -pp options.

-vv   Verbose option: print  the names of all affected files.  Can
     be  used  only  with the  -ii  option.   Provides a  detailed
     listing when used with the -tt option.

***** Operands *****

The following operands are available:

_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
     This names the files to  be manipulated by ccppiioo. This can be
     a simple regular expression.

_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     The destination directory.

***** Multi-Volume Operation *****

ccppiioo supports multi-volume backups and restoration when using the
``raw''  (i.e.,  character-special)  floppy  device.  If  a  ccppiioo
archive exceeds the size  of one floppy diskette, ccppiioo will issue
a prompt of the form:


        Ready for volume 2
        Type "device/name" when ready to proceed ...


Remove the  first diskette and insert  the next logical diskette.
Enter  the  name  of  the  floppy  device,  e.g.   /ddeevv/rrffhhaa00  or
/ddeevv/rrffvvaa11, and press <EEnntteerr>. Please note well that multi-volume
operation  requires the  raw floppy  device and  the use  of pre-
formatted floppy diskettes.

***** Examples *****

The following command  copies all files and directories listed by
the command ffiinndd and copies them into the archive nneewwffiillee.ccppiioo:

cpio                         Command                         cpio



     find . -print | cpio -oc > ../newfile.cpio


The  following command  reads the  ccppiioo archive  nneewwffiillee.ccppiioo and
extracts  all files  whose names  match  the patterns  mmeemmoo/aall or
mmeemmoo/bb*:


     cpio -icdv "memo/al" "memo/b*" <../newfile.cpio


Note that  the -dd option forces ccppiioo  to create the sub-directory
mmeemmoo and  write the  files into  it.  Otherwise, the  files would
have been  written into the current  directory.  Option -vv causes
ccppiioo  to display  each  file name  as  it is  extracted from  the
archive.

The following commands perform a multi-volume backup of all files
on mounted filesystem /vv to the character-special (i.e., ``raw'')
floppy device /ddeevv/rrffhhaa00:


        su root
        cd /v
        find . -print | cpio -ocv >/dev/rfha0


If the ccppiioo archive exceeds one diskette, you will be prompted to
insert another formatted diskette.
