Perform maintenance chores, single-user mode

/eettcc/bbrrcc

The shell  script /etc/brc is  executed by the  init process when
the COHERENT system enters single-user mode.  The commands in brc
do such things as set system  clock, set the local time zone, and
call fsck to scan and (if necessary) fix all file systems on your
machine.
