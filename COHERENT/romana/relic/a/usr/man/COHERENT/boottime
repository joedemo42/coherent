Time the system was last booted


/etc/boottime is an empty file maintained by the init process and
the  date command.   The modification time  of boottime,  as dis-
played by the command llss -ll, is the time that the system was last
booted.  You can  read the time shown by bboooottttiimmee  with llss -ll, or
with the system calls stat or fstat.

***** Notes *****

Commands that  depend upon  /etc/boottime may malfunction  if the
system's date is not set correctly.  For instance, the mount com-
mand depends on  the relative modification times of /etc/boottime
and  /etc/mtab to  detect whether  the mount  table has  been in-
validated by a system boot.   If the date is set sufficiently far
into the  past, the mount  table may appear  to be valid  when in
fact it is not.
