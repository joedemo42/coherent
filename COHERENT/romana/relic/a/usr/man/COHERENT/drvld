drvld                        Command                        drvld




Load a loadable driver into memory

/eettcc/ddrrvvlldd -rr _d_r_i_v_e_r

drvld loads a loadable  driver into memory.  driver names a load-
able driver.  Only the superuser root can run drvld.

A loadable driver is one that  is not linked into the kernel when
it was built.  The current suite of loadable drivers include mul-
ti-port serial  cards, various SCSI host  adaptors, and a variety
of  add-on  cards.   The  COHERENT  drivers  for  shared  memory,
semaphores, and message  passing are also implemented as loadable
drivers, due to the efficient size of the COHERENT kernel.

The  -r  option to  drvld specifies  that any temporary  files it
creates in directory /tmp should be removed.

Note that drvld expects to  find its entry in directory /drv, not
in /dev.
