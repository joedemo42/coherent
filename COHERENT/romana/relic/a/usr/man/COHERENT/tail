ttaaiill [+_n[bbccffll]] [_f_i_l_e]

tail copies  the last part of  file, or of the  standard input if
none is named, to the standard output.

The  given number  tells tail  where to begin  to copy  the data.
Numbers of  the form +number measure the  starting point from the
beginning of the file; those of the form -number measure from the
end of the file.

A specifier of blocks, characters,  or lines (bb, c, or l, respec-
tively) may follow the number;  the default is lines.  If no num-
ber is specified, a default of -10 is assumed.

The -ff  option opens the  tail of a  file, and then  displays new
material as it is added to a file.  This command lets you watch a
file as it is being built, such as by nnrrooffff.  Note that when tail
is invoked  with this option,  it does not  exit; therefore, when
you wish to exit, type the interrupt character.

***** Notes *****

Because  tail buffers  data measured  from the  end of  the file,
large counts may not work.
