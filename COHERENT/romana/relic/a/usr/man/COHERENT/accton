Enable/disable process accounting

/eettcc/aaccccttoonn [ _f_i_l_e ]

One of the accounting mechanisms available on the COHERENT system
is process accounting, also called shell accounting.  Process ac-
counting each process, who initiates it, and how long it takes to
execute.

By issuing  the command accton  with a file  argument, you enable
process accounting.   The system then writes  raw accounting data
into file,  which normally should be  /usr/adm/acct.  The command
sa summarizes  the resulting raw  statistics.  If issued  with no
argument, accton disables process accounting.

accton  is normally  invoked by  the initialization  command file
/etc/rc.

***** Notes *****

As  the file  /usr/adm/acct can become  very large,  special care
should be  taken if process  accounting is enabled  on a COHERENT
system with a small disk file system.
