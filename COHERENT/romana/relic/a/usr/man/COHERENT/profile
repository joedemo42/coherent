Set user's environment


The profile is a set of commands that customizes how the COHERENT
system deals  with an  individual user.   The shell sh  reads the
file /etc/profile  and executes the commands  therein when a user
logs in.

If /etc/passwd  specifies a program in the  login shell slot then
/etc/profile is  read by /bin/sh and those  lines which begin ex-
port are recognized  as global environments, and the remainder of
the line is inserted into the environment.

Please note  that if /bin/sh is not  the shell, any constructions
other than


        export foo=value


are not likely to work.
