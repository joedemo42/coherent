ssttrriinnggss [-ddooppxx] [-_l_e_n_g_t_h] [_f_i_l_e ... ]

ssttrriinnggss looks  for ASCII strings in a  binary file.  A ``string''
is defined as any  sequence of four or more printable characters.
ssttrriinnggss is  useful for identifying  unknown object files,  or for
looking at the messages printed by commands.  You can also use it
as a filter if _f_i_l_e is not specified.

ssttrriinnggss recognizes the following command-line options:

-dd  Precede each string by its offset in the file in decimal.

-oo  Precede each string by its offset in the file in octal.

-pp  Strip the  parity bits of all characters  in the string prior
    to comparison.

-xx  Precede each string by its offset in the file in hexadecimal.

Finally, the  option -_l_e_n_g_t_h forces ssttrriinnggss to  use _l_e_n_g_t_h as the
minimum length for a printable string.
