Raise multiple-precision integer to power

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  spow
raises the  multiple-precision integer (or mmiinntt)  pointed to by a
to the power of n, and writes the result into the mmiinntt pointed to
by b.  In no case may the exponent be negative.
