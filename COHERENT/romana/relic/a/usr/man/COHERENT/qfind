qfind                        Command                        qfind




Find all files with a given name

qqffiinndd [-aaddpp] _n_a_m_e ...
qqffiinndd [-bb]

qqffiinndd prints the  full path name of each file  with a given _n_a_m_e.
When invoked  with the -bb option,  it builds a data  base in file
/uussrr/aaddmm/qqffffiilleess; this  data base names every  file and directory
in the  system.  When invoked without the  -bb option, qqffiinndd reads
this data base to find file names fairly quickly.

Normally, qqffiinndd  prints the  full path name  of each file  in the
COHERENT system  that ends with  the given _n_a_m_e (as  they were at
the time  you last executed qqffiinndd -bb.) With  the -dd option, qqffiinndd
prints  matching  directories  instead  of  files.  With  the  -aa
option,   qqffiinndd   prints  both   matching   files  and   matching
directories.

Option -pp specifies partial name matching.  For example, qqffiinndd -pp
ffoooo  matches files  /ssrrcc/ffoooo.cc  and /ddoocc/ffoooo.rr  as  well as  file
/uussrr/bbiinn/ffoooo.

***** Notes *****

Building the qqffiinndd  data base with the -bb option  is slow, but it
speeds finding files.  You may  find it convenient to use ccrroonn to
execute qqffiinndd -bb to rebuild the data base at night, or some other
time when the machine is otherwise idle.  The superuser rroooott must
run qqffiinndd -bb if you want all files to appear in the data base.
