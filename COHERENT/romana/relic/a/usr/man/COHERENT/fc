fc                           Command                           fc




Edit and re-execute one or more previous commands

ffcc [-llnn] [_f_i_r_s_t [_l_a_s_t]]
ffcc -ss [_o_l_d=_n_e_w] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]"

ffcc, the  ``fix command'', is a command built  into the Korn shell
kksshh. It  permits you to edit and re-execute  one or more commands
that have been executed previously.

ffcc  has two  forms, as  shown above.   The first  version selects
commands _f_i_r_s_t through _l_a_s_t  and inserts them into a text editor.
You can edit the commands  in the editor; exiting from the editor
re-executes the edited commands.

_f_i_r_s_t and  _l_a_s_t can be  addressed either by  the command's number
(the first command issued to  the shell is number one, the second
is  number two,  and so  on),  or by  a string  that matches  the
beginning of the command.  The editor  used is the one set in the
environmental variable FFCCEEDDIITT (default, eedd).

When  called without  a _l_a_s_t variable,  the command  selects just
_f_i_r_s_t.  Option -ll  prints  the commands  on  the standard  output
rather than buffering  the commands for editing and re-execution.
Option -nn suppresses the default command numbers.

The  second form  of the  ffcc command  substitutes string  _n_e_w for
string _o_l_d  within _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, then re-executes  it.  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d can be
addressed either  by its number  or by a string  that matches its
beginning.   If  no  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  is  specified, it  re-executes  the
previous command.
