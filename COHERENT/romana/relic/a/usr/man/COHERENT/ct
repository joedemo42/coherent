Controlling terminal driver


For each process,  the controlling terminal driver /dev/tty is an
interface  to the appropriate  terminal driver.   COHERENT passes
any input-output call  (e.g.  cclloossee, iiooccttll, ooppeenn, rreeaadd, or wwrriittee)
on this special  file directly to the controlling terminal device
for the requesting process.

Normally, the controlling terminal is the default standard input,
output,  and  error device.   This  is not  the  case for  daemon
processes started by the initial process.

When a call finds no valid controlling terminal for a process, it
returns a value of -1 and sets errno to ENXIO.
