Convert long integer to file system block number

llttooll33(_l_3_p, _l_p, _n)

To conserve  space inside i-nodes  in COHERENT file  systems, the
system  stores block  addresses  in three  bytes.  Programs  that
reference or  maintain file systems  use the functions  l3tol and
ltol3 to  convert between the three  byte representation and long
numbers.

ltol3 converts n long integers  at address lp to the more compact
form at address l3p.
