Transmit data to or from a remote site

/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/uuuucciiccoo [ -rr11 ] [ -ss_s_i_t_e ] [ -SS_s_i_t_e ]

uucico is  the UUCP command  that actually transfers  files to or
from a remote site.  Its syntax is as follows:

-rr11  Poll site unconditionally.

-ss_s_i_t_e
     The name  of the site to  be polled.  site must  name one of
     the entries in /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys.

-SS_s_i_t_e
     The name  of the site to  be polled.  site must  name one of
     the entries  in /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys.  Unlike  the -s option,
     force execution even if not the correct time.

The messages sent by  uucico are differentiated by the first let-
ter of the message.

***** Example *****

To poll the  site sys at five minutes after  the hour, each hour,
put the following entry into /usr/lib/crontab:


        05 * * * * /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -ssys -r1
