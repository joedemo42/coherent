Set/change login password

ppaasssswwdd [_u_s_e_r]

passwd sets  or changes the password for  the specified user.  If
user is not specified, passwd changes the password of the caller.

passwd requests  that the old password (if any)  be typed, to en-
sure the caller  is who he claims to be.   Next it requests a new
password, and  then requests it  again in case  of typing errors.
passwd will  ask for a  longer password if  the one given  is too
short or not unusual enough.
