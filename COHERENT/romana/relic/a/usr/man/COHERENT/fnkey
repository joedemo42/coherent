Set/print function keys

ffnnkkeeyy [ _n [ _s_t_r_i_n_g ] ]

The console  keyboard of  an IBM  AT COHERENT system  includes 10
special  function  keys,  labelled  F1 through  F10.   Initially,
typing these keys has no effect.

fnkey with  a numeric argument  n in the  range 1 to  10 programs
function key Fn to send the given string.  If no string is given,
fnkey resets  Fn to send  nothing.  If n  is 0, fnkey  resets all
function keys to send nothing.

With no argument, fnkey  prints the current string for each func-
tion key.

***** Example *****

The  following example  programs function key  FF22 to  execute the
COHERENT command date:


        fnkey 2 'date
        '


Note that this command sets F2 to the string ddaattee\nn.  If you type
fnkey  without any  arguments, it  prints  the following  on your
screen:


        F2:  date\n
