The ``bit bucket''


All data  written to  the special  file /dev/null is  thrown away
(sent to  the ``bit bucket'').   This is useful,  for example, to
test a program's side effects while ignoring its output.

A read  from file  /dev/null returns end  of file (zero  bytes of
data).   The  shell  sh uses  /dev/null  as  input to  background
processes.
