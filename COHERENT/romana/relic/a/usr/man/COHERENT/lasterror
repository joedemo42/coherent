The environmental  variable LASTERROR  names the last  program to
have returned  an error  to the shell.   For example, if  you had
used the  command set with  an incorrect number  of arguments, it
would have failed to run and would have exited with an error con-
dition, and LASTERROR would read LASTERROR=set.

The  command help  reads  LASTERROR to  determine  what the  last
program was  for which you  needed help.  Thus, if  you type help
without an argument, it will return information about the program
named in LASTERROR.
