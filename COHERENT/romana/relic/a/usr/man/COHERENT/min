The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform  multiple-precision  mathematics.  The  function  min
reads a  multiple-precision integer  (or mmiinntt) from  the standard
input and  writes it at the  address held by a.   The base of the
mmiinntt  is indicated  by the  value held  in the  external variable
ibase.

min accepts  leading blanks and  an optional leading  minus sign;
the number is terminated by the first non-legal digit.
