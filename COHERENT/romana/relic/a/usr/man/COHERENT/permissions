The  file  PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss   describes  the  remote  sites  that  can
communicate  via UUCP  with your COHERENT  system, and  lists the
programs that  each site  can execute  on your system.   Before a
remote site can  communicate with your COHERENT system, that site
must have an entry in PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss.

When the command uuuucciiccoo attempts to execute a file transfer to or
from a remote  site, it checks to see that  there is an entry for
the  site in  PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss. If  your  PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss entries  are not
written correctly, you risk a breach of system security.

Each entry in PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss takes one of two forms:

-> LLOOGGNNAAMMEE   entries  detail  the   permissions  granted   to  an
   individual user when he calls your system from a remote site.

-> MMAACCHHIINNEE entries  detail the  permissions for the  remote sites
   that you call.

You can  combine the two types  of entries into one  entry if the
permissions are the same in both entries.

An entry in PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss consists  of pairs of entries of the form
_O_P_T_I_O_N=_v_a_l_u_e,   each  separated  by   one  or   more  white-space
characters.  The  _O_P_T_I_O_N side  must be in  upper-case characters,
and the _v_a_l_u_e side in  lower-case characters.  At the end of each
line (except  the last), you  must include a  backslash character
(`\')  to continue  the current  line onto  the next  one.  Blank
lines between entries are ignored.

For the RREEAADD, NNOORREEAADD, WWRRIITTEE, and NNOOWWRRIITTEE fields, described below,
the value  specified is a sequence of one  or more directories on
your  computer, separated  only by colons  (i.e., no  white space
allowed).

An entry in PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss can have up to ten fields:

1. MMAACCHHIINNEE
     This  field  names  the  remote  system  that  you  wish  to
     communicate  with.   It  is  limited  to  seven  characters.
     (Future releases of COHERENT will increase this limit.)

2. LLOOGGNNAAMMEE
     This field  specifies the login name  that the remote system
     will use when it calls your system.  Please note that if the
     remote site  attempts to log  into your system  with a login
     name other than the one specified by this field, uuuucciiccoo will
     terminate the  call for security  reasons.  There must  be a
     valid entry  in file /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd  for the name  specified in
     this field.

3. RREEAADD
     This  entry names  the directories on  your system  that the
     UUCP commands can access.   You must give the full path name
     of the directory.  The default is /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccppppuubblliicc.

4. NNOORREEAADD
     When a  directory is entered  in the RREEAADD field,  all of its
     sub-directories become  available for reading.   If you wish
     to make any  of its sub-directories unreadable by the remote
     site, name it here.  You must give the full path name of the
     directory.  The default is NULL.

5. WWRRIITTEE
     Here,  name the  directories on your  system into  which the
     command uuuucciiccoo  can deposit files.   You must give  the full
     path    name   of   the    directory.    The    default   is
     /uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccppppuubblliicc.

6. NNOOWWRRIITTEE
     When a  directory is entered in the  WWRRIITTEE field, the remote
     system can  write into all  of its sub-directories.   If you
     wish to  make any of its  sub-directories unwriteable by the
     remote site,  enter it  here.  You  must give the  full path
     name of the directory.  The default is NULL.

7. CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     Here, name  the commands that the  remote system can execute
     on your  computer.  The  two most  basic commands to  put in
     this entry  are rrmmaaiill  and uuuuccpp.  This lets the  remote site
     send  electronic mail  to you  and to  use uucp  to transfer
     files.   You may  add other  commands,  but the  shorter the
     list,  the  greater  your  level  of system  security.   The
     default is rrmmaaiill.

8. RREEQQUUEESSTT
     This entry  asks if the remote site  can request to transfer
     files from  your system.  Respond yyeess if  security is not an
     issue.  If  the value  is nnoo,  only your system  can request
     that files be  transfered to the remote system.  The default
     is nnoo.

9. SSEENNDDFFIILLEESS
     This entry  asks if your system  can initiate file transfers
     to the remote site.  Your  response can be yyeess, nnoo, or ccaallll.
     The default is ccaallll, which allows files to be sent only when
     your system  calls the remote  site.  A value  of yyeess allows
     your  system   to  transfer  files  to   the  remote  system
     regardless of  which system originated  the conversation.  A
     value of nnoo prohibits any file transfers from your system to
     the remote system.

10. MMYYNNAAMMEE
     This  field  contains  the  site  name  that you  have  been
     assigned by the system administrator of the remote site.  It

Permissions                File Format                Permissions



     must contain  no more than  seven characters.  If  MMYYNNAAMMEE is
     defined, its value is used as your site name rather than the
     value in  /eettcc/uuuuccppnnaammee. This is useful  in situations where
     your site name is already used by an existing account on the
     remote site  you wish to call, or when  the remote site does
     not support ``anonymous'' UUCP access.

When writing your  Permissions file, keep these considerations in
mind:

-> White space is not allowed before or after the `=' sign.

-> Each line  corresponds to one  entry. You may  continue to the
   next line by ending the line with a backslash charcter (`\').

-> If a  field has more than  one value, use a  colon to separate
   them.

***** Example *****

The following  example gives an entry in PPeerrmmiissssiioonnss  to set up a
connection with the Mark Williams Company's UUCP BBS:


       MACHINE=mwcbbs MYNAME=bbsuser \
       REQUEST=yes SENDFILES=yes \
       COMMANDS=rmail:uucp \
       READ=/usr/spool/uucppublic:/tmp \
       WRITE=/usr/spool/uucppublic:/tmp
