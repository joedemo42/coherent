Split a large file into smaller files

sspplliitt [-_n_l_i_n_e_s][_i_n_f_i_l_e [_o_u_t_f_i_l_e] ]

split divides  a file  into a number  of smaller files.   This is
useful for  programs that cannot handle  arbitrarily large files,
such as MicroEMACS.

split uses infile as its  input file if given; otherwise, it uses
the standard  input.  If infile  is `-', split  uses the standard
input.

split puts  its output into files with  names prefixed by outfile
and suffixed  consecutively with  aa, ab, ac,  and so on.   If no
outfile is specified, file names are prefixed with x.

Normally,  split puts  1,000  lines in  each  output file.   This
default may be changed  by the option -nlines, where nlines gives
the desired number of lines per file.
