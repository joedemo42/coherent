nlist()                  General Function                 nlist()




Symbol table lookup

#include <l.out.h>
iinntt nnlliisstt(_f_i_l_e, _n_l_p)
cchhaarr *_f_i_l_e;
ssttrruucctt nnlliisstt *_n_l_p;

nlist searches  the name list  (symbol table) of  the load module
file for  each symbol in  the array pointed  to by nlp.   For ex-
ample, the command ps uses this routine on the system load module
(/ccoohheerreenntt) to  obtain the addresses  of system tables  in memory
(/ddeevv/mmeemm).

nlp  points to  an  array of  nlist structures,  terminated by  a
structure with  a null string  as its n_name  member.  The header
file l.out.h defines nlist as follows:


#define   NCPLN16

struct nlist {
     char n_name[NCPLN];
     int  n_type;
     unsignedn_value;
};


The caller  should set the  entry n_name; nlist will  fill in the
other entries.  nlist sets both n_type and n_value to zero if the
symbol is not found.

If  file  is not  a  load  module or  has  had  its symbol  table
stripped, all returned n_type and n_value entries will be zero.
