zcat                         Command                         zcat




Concatenate a compressed file

zzccaatt [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

zcat concatenates one or more files that had been compressed with
the command compress.   It uncompresses each file ``on the fly,''
and prints the uncompressed text onto the standard output.

If no file is  specified on the command, zcat uncompresses matter
read from the standard input.

Older versions of zcat  could only uncompress files that had been
compressed with option -b12 or lower, with -b12 being the default
if  the option  was omitted.   This release  of zcat  now handles
values up  to -b16  by using  RAM device /dev/ram1  for temporary
storage.  For  this reason, it  is strongly advised  that you not
use /dev/ram1 as a RAM disk.
