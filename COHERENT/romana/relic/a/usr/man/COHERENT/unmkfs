Create a prototype file system

uunnmmkkffss [-_p_r_e_f_i_x] _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y _n_b_l_o_c_k_s [_f_i_l_e]

unmkfs scans directory  and builds prototype files with which you
can build file systems on backup disks.

If prefix is given, it creates files _p_r_e_f_i_x.pp0011, _p_r_e_f_i_x.pp0022, etc.
If it is not given, unmkfs writes its output to the standard-out-
put device.

nblocks  gives the  maximum size of  a prototype  file.  COHERENT
current defines  a block  as being  512 bytes (half  a kilobyte);
thus, to make the maximum  size of a prototype file 10 kilobytes,
set nblocks to 20.

The file  option tells unmkfs to suppress  all files in directory
that are older than file.  If  it is not used, then unmkfs builds
prototypes for all files in directory.

unmkfs provides a useful way  to back up file systems onto floppy
disks.  To do this, perform the following steps:

11. unmkfs a directory, producing prototype files.

22. Format one floppy disk for each prototype file.

33. Using the prototype files in sucession, mkfs each floppy disk.
   This  puts the  indicated files  onto floppy  disk, preserving
   links.

Later, you  can use  the command cpdir  to restore all  the files
from the  floppy disks, or  you can use cp  to restore individual
files.

***** Notes *****

unmkfs builds a file system in  memory as it does its work.  With
large directory structures, it can run out of memory.
