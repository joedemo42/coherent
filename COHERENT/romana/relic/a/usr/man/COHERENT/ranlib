Create index for library

rraannlliibb _l_i_b_r_a_r_y ...

ranlib creates an index for a library created by the archiver ar.
This greatly  increases the  speed with  which the linker  ld can
search a library, and so link your program.

ranlib inserts at the beginning  of the library a sorted index of
all  global symbols  defined in  object  modules in  the library,
together with  the offset of  the module in the  library.  If the
index already exists, ranlib updates it.

***** Diagnostics *****

ranlib issues  appropriate messages for I/O  errors or bad format
files.  It  does not  rewrite a  library until the  last possible
moment, so  the library  is usually  unchanged in case  of error.
ranlib processes each  library independently.  The exit status is
the number of libraries in which errors were encountered.
