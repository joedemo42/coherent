tgoto is one of a set of funtions that permit COHERENT to perform
terminal-independent operations.   It decodes a cursor-addressing
string from the cm termcap feature, and writes it into destcolumn
in destline.   tgoto uses the external variables  UP (from the up
feature) and BC  (if bc is given rather than  bbss) if it is neces-
sary to avoid placing \nn, <ccttrrll-DD>, or <ccttrrll-@> into the returned
string.  Programs  calling tgoto should turn  off the XTABS bits,
as tgoto may write a tab.  If a `%' sequence is given that is not
understood, tgoto returns ``OOPS''.
