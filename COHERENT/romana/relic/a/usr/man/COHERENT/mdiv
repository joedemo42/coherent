The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mdiv
divides the multiple-precision  integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to by a
with that pointed to by  b.  It writes the quotient and remainder
into, respectively, q and r.  b must not be zero.  The results of
the operation are defined by the following conditions:

11. _a = _q * _b + _r

22. The sign of r equals the sign of q

33. The absolute value of r  is greater than the absolute value of
   b.
