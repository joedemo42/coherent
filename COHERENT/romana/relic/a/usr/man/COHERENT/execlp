The COHERENT  system includes six functions  that allow a process
to execute  another executable file.  execlp  initializes the new
stack of the  process to contain a list of  strings that are com-
mand arguments.  It  specifies arguments individually, as a NULL-
terminated list  of arg parameters.  Unlike  the related function
execl, execlp  searches for file in all  directories named in the
environmental variable PATH.  For more information on program ex-
ecution, see execution.

***** Diagnostics *****

execlp does not return  if successful.  It returns -1 for errors,
such as  file not existing in the directories  named in PATH, not
accessible with  execute permission, having a  bad format, or too
large to fit in memory.
