The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mtoi
returns an  integer equal to the  value of the multiple-precision
integer (or  mmiinntt) pointed to  by a.  The  value pointed to  by a
should be in the range allowable for a signed integer.
