The COHERENT  system includes six functions  that allow a process
to execute another  executable file (or load module, as described
in the  header l.out.h).  execv specifies  arguments as a single,
NULL-terminated  array of  parameters, called  argv.   Unlike the
related  program  execve, execv  passes  the  environment of  the
calling program  to the called program.   For more information on
program execution, see execution.

such as file  being nonexistent, not accessible with execute per-
mission, having a bad format, or too large to fit in memory.
