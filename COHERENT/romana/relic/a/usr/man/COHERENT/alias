alias                        Command                        alias




Set an alias

aalliiaass [-dd] [_n_a_m_e[=_v_a_l_u_e ...]]

The command aalliiaass is used by the Korn shell kksshh to set or display
an alias.

When  called without  an argument, aalliiaass  lists all  aliases that
have been set so far.  When called with a _n_a_m_e argument alone, it
lists alias of _n_a_m_e, assuming one has been set.

When called with one or more arguments of the form _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e, it
established _n_a_m_e as an  alias for the command _v_a_l_u_e. For example,
the command


        alias FOO="echo bar"


establishes the string FFOOOO as  an alias for the command eecchhoo bbaarr.
Thereafter, when  you type  FFOOOO on  the shell's command  line, it
will execute the  command eecchhoo bbaarr and so echo  the string bbaarr on
your terminal.

The  Korn shell  sets a  number of aliases  by default.   See the
Lexicon  entry for  kksshh for  a  list of  these aliases  and their
settings.
