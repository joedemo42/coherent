Mount file systems at boot time

/eettcc/mmoouunntt.aallll

The file  /eettcc/mmoouunntt.aallll holds a  set of mmoouunntt  commands to mount
all COHERENT  file systems  on hard disk.   It is invoked  by the
script /eettcc/rrcc, which COHERENT reads and executes at boot-time.

When you add a new  COHERENT partition to your system, you should
insert an  appropriate entry into  this file, to  ensure that the
new partition is mounted whenever you reboot your system.
