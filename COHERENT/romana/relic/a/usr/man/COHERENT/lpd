Line printer spooler daemon

/usr/lib/lpd

lpd is  a daemon program  that runs in the  background and prints
listings queued  by the command lpr.  It  is run automatically by
lpr.  If there is no printing  to do, or if another daemon is al-
ready  running  (indicated  by  the  file  dpid), lpd  exits  im-
mediately.  Otherwise,  it searches the spool  directory for con-
trol files of listings to print.  These control files contain the
names of files to print, the  user name, banners, and files to be
removed upon completion.

lpd does not print listings in any particular order.  Priority is
not given to any priority, either by size nor by requester.

The  command lpskip  command terminates  or restarts  the current
line printer listing.
