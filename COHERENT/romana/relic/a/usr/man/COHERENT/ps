Print process status

ppss [ -aaffggllmmnnrrttwwxx ] [ -cc _s_y_s ] [ -kk _m_e_m ]

ps prints  information about a  process or processes.   It prints
the information  in fields, followed by the  command name and ar-
guments.  The fields include the following:

TTTTYY     The controlling terminal of the command, printed in short
        form.  ``44:'' means  /dev/tty44 and ``??:''  means there
        is no controlling terminal.

PPIIDD     Process id; necessary  to know when the  process is to be
        killed.

GGRROOUUPP   PID of the group leader of the process; the shell started
        up when the user logs in.

PPPPIIDD    PID of the parent of the process; very often a shell.

UUIIDD     User id or name of the owner.

KK       Size of the process in kilobytes.

FF       Process flag bits, as follows:
        PPFFCCOORREE  00001 Process is in core
        PPFFLLOOCCKK  00002 Process is locked in core
        PPFFSSWWIIOO  00004 Swap I/O in progress
        PPFFSSWWAAPP  00010 Process is swapped out
        PPFFWWAAIITT  00020 Process is stopped (not waited)
        PPFFSSTTOOPP  00040 Process is stopped (waited on)
        PPFFTTRRAACC  00100 Process is being traced
        PPFFKKEERRNN  00200 Kernel process
        PPFFAAUUXXMM  00400 Auxiliary segments in memory
        PPFFDDIISSPP  01000 Dispatch at earliest convenience
        PPFFNNDDMMPP  02000 Command mode forbids dump
        PPFFWWAAKKEE  04000 Wakeup requested


SS       State of the process, as follows:
        RR       Ready to run (waiting for CPU time)
        SS       Stopped for other reasons (I/O completion, pause, etc.)
        TT       Being traced by another process
        WW       Waiting for an existent child
        ZZ       Zombie (dead, but parent not waiting)


EEVVEENNTT   The condition which the process  is anticipating; not ap-
        plicable if the process is ready to run.

CCVVAALL SSVVAALL IIVVAALL RRVVAALL
        Scheduling information; bigger is better.

UUTTIIMMEE   Time consumed while running in the program (in seconds).

SSTTIIMMEE   Time consumed while running in the system (in seconds).

Normally,  ps displays  the  TTY and  PID fields  of each  active
process started on the  caller's terminal, as well as the command
name and arguments.  The following flags can alter this behavior.

aa    Display  information about  processes started from  all ter-
     minals.

cc     The next  argument sys  gives  the system  executable image
     (default:  /coherent).  The namelist  is searched  for table
     addresses.

dd    Print information about status of loadable drivers.

ff    Blank  fields have  `-' place-holders.  This  enables field-
     oriented commands like sort and awk to process the output.

gg    Print the group leader field GROUP if the ll option is given.

ll    Long format.  In addition  to the TTY and PID fields, prints
     the PPID, UID, K, F, S and EVENT fields.

kk     The  next   argument  mem  is  the  memory  file  (default:
     /dev/mem).

mm    Print the scheduling fields CVAL, SVAL, IVAL and RVAL.

nn    Suppress the header line.

rr    Print the real size  of the process, which includes the user
     and auxiliary segments assigned to the process.  Because the
     user segment (usually 1 kilobyte) is shared by all processes
     owned by  that user, this  may give a  misleading total size
     for all the user's processes.

tt    Print elapsed CPU time fields UTIME and STIME.

ww    Wide format output; print 132 columns instead of 80.

xx    Display  processes which do not  have a controlling terminal
     (e.g. the swapper).

***** Notes *****

Each  process can  modify  or destroy  its command  name and  ar-
guments.  The state of the system changes even as ps runs.
