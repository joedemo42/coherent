tee                          Command                          tee




Branch pipe output

tteeee [ -aa ] [ -ii ] [ _f_i_l_e ...]

tee reads from standard input,  usually a pipe, and writes to the
standard output,  usually a pipe.  tee also writes  a copy of the
input data to each file specified.

The -a flag  tells tee to append data to  each file, analogous to
the shell construct ``>>_f_i_l_e''.  Otherwise, it creates each file,
analogous to the construct ``>_f_i_l_e''.

The flag -i means ignore interrupts.
