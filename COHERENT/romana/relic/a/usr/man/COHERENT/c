c                            Command                            c




Print multi-column output

cc [ -_l _N ] [ -w N ] [ -012 ]

c reads lines from the  standard input and writes them in columns
on the standard output.  The  longest input line and the width of
the page determine how many columns will fit across the page.

c recognizes the following options:

-ll _N  Set the length  of the page  to N lines.   c columnizes its
     output by pages when this option is used with mode 1 or mode
     2.

-ww _N Set  the width of the page to  N characters.  The default is
     80.

-00   Multi-column  mode 0.  Order the  fields horizontally across
     the page.

-11   Multi-column mode 1 (default mode).  Order the fields verti-
     cally down each column; the last column may be short.

-22   Multi-column mode 2.   Order the fields similarly to mode 1,
     but place  blank fields in the last  output line rather than
     the last column.

Options  may  also  be given  in  the  environmental variable  C,
separated by white  space.  Command line options override options
in the environment.  For example,


        export C="-l56 -w72 -2"
        c -w80 <file1


has the same effect as


        c -l56 -w72 -2 -w80 <file1


This command sets the page width to 80 rather than to 72.

***** Diagnostics *****

c prints ``out  of memory'' and returns an exit  status of one if
it cannot allocate enough memory to process its input.
