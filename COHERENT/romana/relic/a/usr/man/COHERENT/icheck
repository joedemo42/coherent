i-node consistency check

Each block  in a file  system must be  either free (i.e.,  in the
free  list) or  allocated (i.e., associated  with exactly  one i-
node).  icheck examines each specified filesystem, printing block
numbers that  are claimed by more than one  i-node, or claimed by
both an i-node and the free list.  It also checks for blocks that
appear more  than once in the  block list of an  i-node or in the
free list.

The option -v (verbose) causes icheck to print a summary of block
usage in  the filesystem.  The option -s  causes icheck to ignore
the free  list, to note which blocks are  claimed by i-nodes, and
to rebuild  the free  list with the  remainder.  A list  of block
numbers may be submitted with the -b flag; icheck prints the data
structure  associated  with  each block  as  the  file system  is
scanned.

The raw  device should be used, and the  filesystem should be un-
mounted if possible.  If this  is not possible (e.g., on the root
file  system) and  the  -s option  is  used, the  system must  be
rebooted immediately to expunge the obsolete superblock.

The exit status bits for a bad return are as follows:


     00xx0011 Miscellaneous error (e.g. out of space)
     00xx0022 Too hard to fix without human intervention
     00xx0044 Bad free block
     00xx0088 Missing blocks
     00xx1100 Duplicates in free list
     00xx2200 Bad block in free list

The message  ``dups in  free'' indicates a  block is in  the free
list more than  once.  ``bad freelist'' indicates the presence of
bad blocks  on the free list.   A ``bad'' block is  one that lies
outside the  bounds of the  file system.  A  ``dup'' (duplicated)
block is one associated with the free list and an i-node, or with
more than  one i-node.   All the  errors above must  be corrected
before the file system is mounted.  ``bad ifree'' means allocated
i-nodes are on the free i-node list; this is inconsequential.

This command has largely been replaced by fsck.
