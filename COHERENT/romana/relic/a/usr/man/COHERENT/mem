Physical memory file


The special file /dev/mem  allows the physical memory of the host
computer to be read and  written just like an ordinary file.  The
location where I/O will occur can be positioned to any valid byte
address by  a call to  lseek.  Note that ps  and related commands
use /dev/kmem, which manipulates the kernel's data space.

Commands  may examine  or  change addresses  in physical  memory.
Addresses to use when changing the system itself normally are ob-
tained from the system load module (/ccoohheerreenntt) name list, so that
they always reflect the currently running version of the system.
