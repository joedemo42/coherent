Subtract multiple-precision integers

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  msub
subtracts the multiple-precision  integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to by
a from the  mmiinntt pointed to by b, and  writes the result into the
mmiinntt pointed to by c.
