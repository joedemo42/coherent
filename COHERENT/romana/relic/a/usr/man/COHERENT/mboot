Master boot block for hard disk


To be bootable, a COHERENT  file system must contain a boot block
(either  boot or  mboot).   In addition, all hard disks must con-
tain the master boot block mboot or an equivalent.

mboot is the master boot block for a hard-disk drive.  It is com-
patible  with, and  therefore can  replace,  the IBM  master boot
block  installed by  the MS-DOS  command FDISK.   It must  be in-
stalled in the first sector of the hard disk, as follows:


        /etc/fdisk -b /conf/mboot /dev/at0x
        /bin/sync


mboot searches its  internal partition table (updated by the com-
mand ffddiisskk) for an active  partition.  The user can select an al-
ternate partition by  pressing 0-3 before the active partition is
selected.  If  the selected partition is of  non-zero size with a
valid  partition boot  block, the partition's  boot block  is ex-
ecuted.  Otherwise, the prompt


        Select partition [0-7]


will appear.
