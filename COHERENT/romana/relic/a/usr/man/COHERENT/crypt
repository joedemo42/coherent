crypt implements  a version of rotor  encryption.  crypt produces
encrypted passwords that  are verified by comparing the encrypted
clear text against an original encryption.

key is an ASCII  string that contains the user's password.  extra
is a string of  two additional characters, stored in the password
file with the  encrypted password.  Each character must come from
an alphabet  of 64 symbols, which consists  of the upper-case and
lower-case letters, digits, the period `.', and the slash `/'.

crypt  returns  a string  built  from  the 64-character  alphabet
described above; the  first two characters returned are the extra
argument, and the rest contain the encrypted password.
