uutouch                      Command                      uutouch




Touch a file to trigger uucico poll

uuuuttoouucchh _s_y_s_t_e_m

uutouch creates an empty control file for system in the directory
/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/_s_y_s_t_e_m.   This forces  UUCP to  poll  system when
uucico is  called with the  option -sany.  If the  empty file for
system aready exists, it is left alone.

There  are   three  types  of   files  in  the   spool  directory
/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/_s_y_s_t_e_m:

CC. Command file.

DD. Data file.

XX. Execute file.

***** Example *****

A typical usage is  to put the following line into /usr/lib/cron-
tab:


        0 7 * * * /usr/lib/uucp/uutouch george


This forces  UUCP to schedule a poll to  the remote system george
at 7  AM local time.  The  actual poll take place  when uucico is
started.

***** Files *****

/uussrr/ssppooooll/uuuuccpp/_s_i_t_e_n_a_m_e -- Directory for uucp work files
