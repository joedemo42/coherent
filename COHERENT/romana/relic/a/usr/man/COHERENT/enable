Enable terminal port

The COHERENT  system is a  multiuser operating system;  it allows
many  users to  use the  system simultaneously.   An asynchronous
communication port connects  each user to the system, normally by
a  terminal or  a modem  attached to the  port.  The  system com-
municates with  the port by means of a  character special file in
directory /dev, such as /ddeevv/ccoomm33rr or /ddeevv/ccoomm22ll.

The COHERENT system will not allow a user to log in on a port un-
til the system creates a  login process for the port.  The enable
command tells the system to create a login process for each given
port.  For example, the command


        /etc/enable com1r


enables port /dev/com1r.

enable  changes the  entry for  each given  port in  the terminal
characteristics  file  /etc/ttys.   The  baud rate  specified  in
/etc/ttys must  be the appropriate baud rate  for the terminal or
modem connected to the port.   See the Lexicon entry for ttys for
more information.

The command disable  disables a port.  The command ttystat checks
whether a port is enabled or disabled.

***** Diagnostics *****

enable normally  returns one if it  enables the port successfully
and  zero if  not.  If  more than one  port is  specified, enable
returns the success or failure  status of the last port it finds.
It returns -1  if it cannot find any given  port.  An exit status
of -2 indicates an error.

***** Notes *****

It is not  recommended that you attempt to enable  a port that is
already enabled.   To make sure, run  /etc/disable before running
/etc/enable.
