until                        Command                        until




Execute commands repeatedly

uunnttiill _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_1
[ ddoo _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_2 ]
done

The shell's  until loop executes  the commands in  sequence1.  If
the exit status is  nonzero, the shell then executes the commands
in the optional sequence2  and repeats the process until the exit
status  of sequence1  is zero.   Because  the shell  recognizes a
reserved word only as the  unquoted first word of a command, both
do and done must occur either  unquoted at the start of a line or
preceded by `;'.

The shell  commands break and continue may be  used to alter con-
trol flow within an until  loop.  The contruct while has the same
form as until but the sense of the test is reversed.

The shell executes until directly.
