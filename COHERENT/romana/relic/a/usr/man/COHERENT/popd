popd                         Command                         popd




Pop an item from the directory stack

ppooppdd [_i_t_e_m ... ]

The COHERENT shell  sshh maintains an internal ``directory stack'',
which is  a stack  of names  of directories.  You  can manipulate
this stack should you, for  any reason, wish to traverse a number
of directories quickly and efficiently.

The  command ppooppdd  pops  an item  from the  directory stack.   If
called without an argument, it pops the last item.  Otherwise, it
pops the  given stack  _i_t_e_ms in  the order requested,  where each
_i_t_e_m is a positive integer and zero is the top of the stack.
