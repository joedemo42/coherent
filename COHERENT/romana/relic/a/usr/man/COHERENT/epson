epson  prints each  file, or  the standard input  if none,  on an
Epson MX-80 printer or compatible.  epson normally sends its out-
put  directly to  the line  printer  /dev/lp.  It  recognizes the
nroff output sequences for boldface and italics and normally con-
verts them to emphasized print and italics.

epson recognizes the following options:

-bb _h_e_a_d
     Print the given head as  a double-width banner at the top of
     the first output page.

-cc   Use compressed printing mode.

-dd   Print  boldface as  double strikes.  Normally,  epson recog-
     nizes the sequence ``_c\bb_c''  as boldface and prints c in em-
     phasized printing  mode.  -d  is useful in  conjunction with
     -c.

-ff   Do not print a formfeed character at the end of each file.

-ii_n  Indent n spaces at the start of each output line.

-oo _o_f_i_l_e
     Send output to ofile instead of /dev/lp.

-rr   Print  all characters in Roman;  do  not use italics.  Norm-
     ally, epson  recognizes the sequence ``_\bb_c''  as italic and
     prints c in its italic character set.

-ss_n  Print n  newlines at the end of each  line.  n must be 1, 2,
     or 3;  the default is 1.

-ww   Use double width printing mode.

-88   Print  lines with vertical  spacing of eight  lines per inch
     instead of the default six lines per inch.
