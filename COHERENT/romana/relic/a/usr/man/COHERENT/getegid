Get effective group identifier

getegid()

Every process has two different versions of its group identifier,
called the  real group identifier  and the effective  group iden-
tifier.   The group identifiers  determine eligibility  to access
files and use system privileges.  Normally, these two identifiers
are identical.   However, for a set  group identifier load module
(see exec), the real group identifier is that of the group's cur-
rent group, whereas the effective group identifier is that of the
load module  owner.  This  distinction allows system  programs to
use  files  which  are  protected  from  groups that  invoke  the
program.

getegid returns the effective group identifier.
