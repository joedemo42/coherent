times reads  CPU time information  about the current  process and
its children, and writes it into the structure pointed to by tbp.
The structure tbuffer is declared in the header file sys/times.h,
as follows:


struct    tbuffer {
     long tb_utime; /* process user time */
     long tb_stime; /* process system time */
     long tb_cutime;/* childrens' user times */
     long tb_cstime;/* childrens' system times */
};


All of  the times  are measured in  basic machine cycles,  or HZ,
which may be obtained from the header file sys/const.h.  Under AT
COHERENT, HZ is 100.

The childrens'  times include  the sum of  the times of  all ter-
minated  child processes  of the  current process  and of  all of
their children.  The  user time represents execution time of user
code, whereas system time represents system overhead, such as ex-
ecuting  system calls, processing  signals, and  other monitoring
functions.
