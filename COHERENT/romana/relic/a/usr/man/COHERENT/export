Add shell variables to environment

When the  shell sh executes  a command, it passes  the command an
environment.   By  convention, the  environment  consists of  as-
signments, each of the form name=value.  For example, typing


        export TERM=vt100


sets the environmental variable TERM to equal the string vt100.

A  command may  look for  information in  the environment  or may
simply ignore it.  In the above example, a program that reads the
variable  TERM (such  as  MicroEMACS) will  assume  that you  are
working on a DEC VT-100 terminal or one that emulates it.

The shell  places the name  and the value of  each shell variable
that appears in an  export command into the environment of subse-
quently executed  commands.  It does  not place a  shell variable
into the environment until it appears in an export command.

With no  arguments, export prints the name and  the value of each
shell variable currently marked for export.

The shell executes export directly.
