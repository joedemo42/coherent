spell builds  a set of unique words from  a document contained in
each input file, or the standard input if none.  It writes a list
of words believed to be misspelled onto the standard output.

spell should normally be invoked with the document in the form of
the input  to the  text formatter  nroff rather than  the output.
spell deletes  control information  to the formatter  by invoking
deroff.

The default dictionary  is for American spelling of English.  The
-a  option specifies  this dictionary  explicitly.  Under  the -b
option, British spelling is checked.  This accepts favour, fibre,
and travelled  rather than  the American spellings  favor, fiber,
and traveled  for the same  words.  Words ending in  ize are also
accepted when ending in ise (e.g., digitize, digitise).

The dictionary has a reasonably complete coverage of proper names
as well as technical terms in certain fields.  However, it covers
some fields  (e.g., computer  science) better than  others (e.g.,
medicine).

***** Notes *****

Dictionaries are not provided for languages other than English.

No dictionary  can be  complete.  You must  add new words  to the
dictionary to ensure that it fully meets your needs.

Obscure words (such as opcodes, variable names, etc.) are flagged
as spelling errors.

Because the  data files required for spell  are quite large, they
might not  be included on COHERENT systems  for machines with in-
sufficient disk  space.  As a result, the  command might not work
as expected on all systems.
