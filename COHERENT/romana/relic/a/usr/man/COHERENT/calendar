Reminder service

ccaalleennddaarr [ -aa ]

calendar is the COHERENT system's ``reminder service''.  It reads
a user's  $HOME directory and looks for  a file called .calendar.
This file  contains information  organized by date.   If calendar
finds .calendar,  it reads it and checks the  date of each entry;
if an  event is scheduled to happen today  or tomorrow, it prints
it.  Thus,  you can use  calendar to remind you  of both one-time
events (such as appointments) and yearly events (such as anniver-
saries).

The following  gives an example  of a .calendar  file.  Note that
ccaalleennddaarr understands different formats of dates:


     Apr 16  Dave's birthday
     7/6     Dad's birthday
     Sep 26  Mom's birthday
     Jun 30  Barry's birthday
     10/4    Marianne's birthday
     Jul 31  Anniversary!
     Mar 16  Pot luck luncheon


Each user can run calendar by embedding the command


     calendar


in his .pprrooffiillee.

If you wish, you can  run calendar automatically for all users on
your system, by inserting it into file /usr/lib/crontab.  In this
case, calendar  should be  used with  its -a option;  this forces
calendar to  search every user's $HOME  directory for a .ccaalleennddaarr
file, and mail the appointments it finds to that user.

Note that calendar's  definition of tomorrow understands weekends
but not  holidays; thus, if  invoked on a Friday,  it will return
the events  for that day and the  following Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday.  If  Monday is a  holiday, however, you  will not receive
appointments for Tuesday.
