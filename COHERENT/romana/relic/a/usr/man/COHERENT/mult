Multiply multiple-precision integers

mmiinntt *_a, *_b, *_c;

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mult
multiplies the multiple-precision  integers (or mmiinntts) pointed to
by a and b, and writes the product into the mmiinntt pointed to by c.
