Describe terminal ports


The  file  /eettcc/ttttyyss  describes  the  terminals in  the  COHERENT
system.  The  process iinniitt reads this file when  it brings up the
system in multi-user mode.

/eettcc/ttttyyss  contains  one  line  for  each  terminal.   Each  line
consists of the following four fields:

11.   The first field is  one character long, and indicates if the
     device is enabled  for logins: `0' indicates that the device
     is  not enabled,  and `1'  (one)  indicates that  logins are
     enabled for the device.

22.   The  second  field  is  one  character long,  and  indicates
     whether  the device  is local (i.e.,  a terminal)  or remote
     (i.e., a  modem): `r' indicates remote,  and `l' (lower-case
     LL)  indicates  local.  If  `r'  is used  and  a password  is
     included  for rreemmaacccc  (remote access)  in  /eettcc/ppaasssswwdd, then
     persons logging in on this device will be required to supply
     the  remote-access  password.  (See  the  Lexicon entry  for
     ppaasssswwdd for more about rreemmaacccc).

33.   The third  field is  one character  long, and sets  the baud
     rate for  the device.  Note that a device  can have either a
     fixed  baud rate,  or a variable  baud rate.   The following
     table gives the codes for fixed baud rates:

     CC       110
     GG       300
     II       1200
     LL       2400
     NN       4800
     PP       9600
     QQ       19200

     The  common  variable-speed  codes  terminal  types  are  as
     follows:

     00       300, 1200, 150, 110
     33       2400, 1200, 300

     When a  user dials into a variable-speed  line, a message is
     sent to  the terminal using the first  speed listed.  If the
     message is unintelligible, the user hits the <bbrreeaakk> key and
     the  system  tries the  next  speed; and  so  on, until  the
     correct speed is selected.

44.   The fourth field names  the port that this device is plugged
     into.   The following  table names  the ports  that COHERENT
     recognizes:

     ccoonnssoollee   The tube and keyboard on your computer

     ccoomm44pprr    Serial port ccoomm44, remote device

     Note that  if field 2 (described above) says  that this is a
     local device, then you  must use a port descriptor that ends
     in `l';  likewise, if field  2 states that this  is a remote
     device,  the  port   descriptor  must  end  in  `r'.   Doing
     otherwise will result in trouble.  See Lexicon entry ccoomm for
     further details.

Do not leave trailing spaces at the end of an entry in /eettcc/ttttyyss.
Leaving blanks  at the  end of a  line usually results  in errors
that state that a device could not  be found.

After  you have  edited /eettcc/ttttyyss,  the following  command forces
COHERENT to re-read the file and use the new descriptions:


          kill quit 1


***** Examples *****

Consider the following ttttyyss entry:


          1lPconsole


Field 1  is the first  character.  Here it  is set to  `1' (one),
which indicates  that the device is enabled  for logins.  Field 2
is the  second character.  Here it is set  to `l' (lower-case LL),
which  indicates that  this is  a local device.   Field 3  is the
third character.   Here, it is  set to `P',  which indicates that
the device  operates at the  fixed baud rate of  9600 baud.  This
field is  ignored by the console device  driver since the console
is not a serial device.  Finally, field 4 is the remainder of the
line.   Here, it  indicates that  the device  in question  is the
console.

Now, consider another example:


          1r3com3r


Field 1  is the first  character.  Here it  is set to  `1' (one),
which indicates  that the device is enabled  for logins.  Field 2
is the second character.  Here  it is set to `r', which indicates
that this  is a  remote device,  i.e., a modem.   Field 3  is the
third character.   Here, it is  set to `3',  which indicates that
the device  operates at  variable baud  rates of 2400,  1200, and
300.  By  hitting the <bbrreeaakk>  key on the terminal,  the user can
select  from  among  those  three  baud  rates,  in  that  order.
Finally,  field  4  is  the  remainder  of the  line.   Here,  it
indicates that the device  in question is plugged into port ccoomm33,
and is accessed via special file /ddeevv/ccoomm33rr.
