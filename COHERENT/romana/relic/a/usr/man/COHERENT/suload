The COHERENT system accesses all devices through drivers residing
in the  system.  Except for the root device,  drivers must be ex-
plicitly loaded  before use; this operation  does not involve re-
booting.

suload  unloads  the   driver  identified  by  major,  which  was
previously loaded by a call to sload.  This call is restricted to
the superuser.

suload returns zero  upon successful unloading of the appropriate
driver, or  -1 on errors.   It fails if  the driver major  is not
loaded.
