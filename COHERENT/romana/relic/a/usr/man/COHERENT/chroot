The root directory is the directory from which file-name searches
commence when  a path name  begins with `/'.   chroot changes the
root directory to directory for the requesting process and all of
its children.

Because of security  problems, chroot is restricted to the super-
user.  It is sometimes useful for a system administrator; for ex-
ample, to test a new system environment that resides on a mounted
file system.

chroot returns zero for a  successful call.  It returns -1 on er-
rors, such as the caller not being the superuser or the directory
being nonexistent or not a directory.
