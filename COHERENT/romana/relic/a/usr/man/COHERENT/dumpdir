dumpdir                      Command                      dumpdir




Print the directory of a dump

dduummppddiirr [aaff [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...] ]

dumpdir reads through a file system dump created by the dump com-
mand, gathers up its directory blocks, and displays the names and
i-numbers of all files on the dump.

The a option causes  dumpdir to display the directory entries for
`.' and `..', which are normally suppressed.

The f option causes the next argument to be taken as the pathname
of the dump device, which is otherwise assumed to be /dev/dump.

If no options are  specified, dumpdir reads from the default dump
device  /dev/dump and  suppresses the  printing  of `.'  and `..'
entries.

***** Files *****

/ddeevv/dduummpp -- Default dump device
/ttmmpp/dddd_X_X_X_X_X_X -- To hold directory blocks

***** Diagnostics *****

The dump/restore  format puts  a header  at the beginning  of the
dump that includes all  the information about what lives where in
the dump.   dumpdir reads this header to  discover what files are
in the  dump.  If the header  is too large to  fit onto one disk,
dumpdir will  then prompt  you to  insert the additional  disk or
disks; if  this happens, insert the requested  disk and then type
<return>.
