Remove text formatting control information

ddeerrooffff [-ww] [-xx] [_f_i_l_e ...]

deroff removes text  formatting control information from each in-
put  text  file,  or  from  the  standard input  if  no  file  is
specified.  It  regards all lines  that begin with `.'  or `'' as
being nroff  commands and  deletes them.  deroff  also recognizes
some additional control  lines.  It deletes eqn information (bet-
ween .EQ  and .EN  lines), tbl  information (between .TS  and .TE
lines), and macro definitions.  It also deletes embedded .eqn re-
quests.  It  expands source file  inclusion with .so  and .nx re-
quests, with  the proviso that  no input file is  read twice.  It
also deletes some troff  escape sequences, such as those for font
and size change.

When  the  -x  flag  is  present,  deroff  uses  some  additional
knowledge about the nroff -ms macro package.

When the  -w flag is  present, deroff divides  the remaining text
into words and prints them  to the standard output, one per line.
A word  comprises a sequence of  letters, digits, and apostrophes
which commences  with a  letter.  deroff strips  apostrophes from
the output.  All  other characters between words are not printed.
The spelling checking programs spell and typo use this option.
