The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mout
writes the  multiple-precision integer (or mmiinntt)  pointed to by a
onto the standard  output.  The base of the output  is set by the
value of the external variable obase.
