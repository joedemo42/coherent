look                         Command                         look




Find matching lines in a sorted file

llooookk [-ddff] ssttrriinngg [_f_i_l_e]

The command look scans the  sorted file and prints each line that
begins with string.

The following options specify the order of the search:

-dd  Use dictionary  order:  the only  characters  tested are  al-
   phanumerics and blanks.

-ff Convert all alphabetic characters to upper case.

If no  file is specified, look uses  /usr/dict/words with the -df
option.

***** Notes *****

Because the file /usr/dict/words  is quite large, it might not be
included  with COHERENT  systems for  machines with  limited disk
space.  As  a result, the  command might not work  as expected on
all systems.
