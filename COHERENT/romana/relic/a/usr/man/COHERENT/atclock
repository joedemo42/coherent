ATclock reads  or sets the system realtime clock  in an IBM PC-AT
system.   With  no  argument, it  reads  the  realtime clock  and
returns  a string  in the  format expected  by the  command date.
With an argument, it sets the realtime clock to the given date.

The system startup files /etc/brc and /etc/rc typically contain a
command of the form


        date -s `/etc/ATclock`


to reset  the time properly  when the COHERENT  system starts up.
The AT realtime  clock typically contains the current local stan-
dard time (not adjusted for daylight savings time).
