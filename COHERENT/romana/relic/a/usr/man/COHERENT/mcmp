Compare multiple-precision integers

#include <mprec.h>

mmiinntt *_a, *_b;

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mcmp
compares the multiple-precision integers (or mmiinntts) pointed to by
a and  b.  It returns  a signed integer  less than, equal  to, or
greater than zero according to  whether the value pointed to by a
is less than, equal to, or greater than that pointed to by b.
