chase is a COHERENT version of  a popular video game.  It runs on
the console  of an  IBM AT COHERENT  system  with input  from the
console  keyboard.  chase  assumes that the  system console  is a
monochrome display adapter unless you select the -c color-display
option.

To  accomodate  different computer  system  speeds and  different
levels of skill, chase prompts the  user to type a speed when the
game begins.  Press <return> to try out the game with the default
speed of  ten; typing  a higher number  makes the game  slower, a
lower number makes it faster.  If you can play at speed zero on a
fast computer system, you play too many video games.  If you know
the speed you want, you  can enter it as a command-line argument.
If you see the boss coming, you can quit by pressing <ctrl-C>.

***** The Rules *****

The player (represented  by a blinking shaded rectangle) attempts
to evade  four ``ghosts'' (represented by  shaded rectangles with
arrows) while erasing dots from the playing-board maze.

At the beginning of a game,  the four ghosts are in the ghost box
above the  center of the  maze and the  player is below  it.  The
maze is filled with dots, including four blinking diamonds called
power pellets.   The ghosts emerge  from the ghost  box and chase
the player.  The console  arrow keys move the player left, right,
up, or down through the  maze.  Typing `0' stops the player.  The
player continues  to move in  the same direction until  a wall of
the maze  stops him, you  type a `0',  or you type  another arrow
key.

When the player eats a  power pellet, he acquires super power and
can chase  the ghosts briefly; the ghosts  change color while the
player has super power.  If the player catches a ghost, he scores
a bonus and the ghost returns to the ghost box temporarily.  Once
a player  eats all the dots  on the board, the  game continues at
the next level.

The upper left corner of the screen displays a score and the cur-
rent board  level.  Each dot  the player eats  scores ten points.
The first ghost a player eats while he has super power scores 200
points, the second 400, the  third 800, and the fourth 1,600.  At
certain times  during the game, a bonus  letter appears below the
ghost box; the player scores 100 points for eating the bonus let-
ter on level `A', 300 on level `B', 500 on level `C', and so on.

The lower left corner of  the screen displays the number of extra
players remaining  in the  current game (initally  two).  Another
bonus player  appears every 10,000 points, to  a maximum of three
extra  players.   The game  ends  when the  ghosts  eat the  last
