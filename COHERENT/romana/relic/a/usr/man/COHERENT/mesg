Permit/deny messages from other users

mmeessgg [yy] [nn]

Normally, a  user can communicate  with other users  by using the
commands msg and write.

In  certain situations,  it is useful  to suppress  messages from
other users.  For example,  if you are redirecting a shell script
to a file and someone sends you a message, that message will land
in  your file.   Therefore, COHERENT  supplies the  command mesg,
which,  lets you  permit or suppress  messages from  other users.
The argument y allows messages, whereas argument n disallows mes-
sages.  With no argument,  mesg tells you whether you can receive
messages (as yes or no) without changing the message state.
