The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision mathematics.   itom creates  a new
multiple-precision  integer  (or  mint),  initializes it  to  the
signed integer value n, and returns a pointer to it.  You can use
the  function mintfr  to  reclaim the  storage used  by the  mint
created by itom.
