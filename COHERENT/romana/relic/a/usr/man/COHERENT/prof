Print execution profile of a C program

pprrooff [ -aabbccss ][ _p_r_o_g_f_i_l_e [ _m_o_n_f_i_l_e ] ]

pprrooff interprets the profile file  produced by an execution of a C
program and  reports the  execution frequencies of  each routine.
It also  reports the percentage  of execution time  spent in each
routine.

pprrooff normally reports  times and frequencies spent for regions of
programs  between  externally  defined  names.  _p_r_o_g_f_i_l_e  is  the
executable program; if omitted, ll.oouutt is assumed.  _m_o_n_f_i_l_e is the
monitor  file  produced  during  execution  of  the  program;  if
omitted, mmoonn.oouutt is assumed.

To produce  mmoonn.oouutt, a program  must be compiled  with the -VVPPRROOFF
option  to  cccc.  To profile  all  modules,  each  module must  be
compiled with this option.

The following options are available.

-aa Profile all symbols, not just externals.

-bb Print all bin information.

-cc Print all call information.

-ss Report stack usage high-water mark.
