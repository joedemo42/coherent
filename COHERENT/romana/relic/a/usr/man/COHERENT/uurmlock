Remove UUCP lock files

uuuurrmmlloocckk

UUCP uses a system of lock  files to ensure that sites are polled
in an  orderly manner.   It creates a  lock file named  after the
site being polled, to  prevent more than one invocation of uuuucciiccoo
or another  UUCP command from  polling the same site  at the same
time.  On occasion, if UUCP  fails or crashes, it will neglect to
clean up its lock  files, thus preventing itself from polling the
locked sites.

The command uuuurrmmlloocckk removes all UUCP lock files.  You should run
this if you suspect that UUCP has died in a disorderly manner and
has left lock files lying around unattended.

Before you run uuuurrmmlloocckk, examine  the output of the command ppss to
ensure that no UUCP command is  running at the moment (and so has
legitimately locked  a site).  Note that  only the superuser rroooott
can run uuuurrmmlloocckk.
