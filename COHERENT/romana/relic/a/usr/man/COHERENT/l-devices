/uussrr/lliibb/uuuuccpp/LL-ddeevviicceess

The file  LL-ddeevviicceess describes  the communication lines  from your
COHERENT system  to other sites.  It indicates  whether a line is
directly  wired or  under modem  control, and  it also  gives the
protocol needed  to manipulate it.  The  command uuuucciiccoo reads the
contents of LL-ddeevviicceess before it attempts to transfer a file to or
from a remote site.

Each  entry in  LL-ddeevviicceess  has five  fields, each  field being  a
string  demarcated by  one or  more white-space  characters.  The
fields are as follows:

11. TTyyppee
     The first  field defines  the type of  line.  A line  can be
     either of two types: DDIIRR (for a directly wired line), or AACCUU
     (for  a modem).   Note the  spelling:  both entries  must be
     entirely in upper case.

22. LLiinnee
     The  second field  defines the  serial  line into  which the
     device is  plugged.  This  entry must specify  the ``local''
     COM device (e.g., ccoomm33ll or hhss0000).

33. DDiissaabbllee
     For modem devices (type  AACCUU), the third field must give the
     remote variant for the entry in field 2 (e.g., for ccoomm33ll the
     entry would  be ccoomm33rr,  for hhss0000  it is hhss0000rr).   The device
     named in  this field must appear in  the file /eettcc/ttttyyss. For
     directly  connected devices  (type DDIIRR),  the device  is the
     same as the entry in the second field.

44. BBaauudd
     The fourth field must give a legal baud rate for your modem,
     as  specified in  the entry in  file /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp  for your
     modem.

55. MMooddeemm
     Field 5  must correctly name your modem  using an entry from
     /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp.

The  file /eettcc/mmooddeemmccaapp  contains  descriptions for  a number  of
popular  modems,  to  spare you  the  trouble  of typing  control
sequences for your modem.  For  a list of the modems described in
this file, as well as available speeds, see the Lexicon entry for
mmooddeemmccaapp.

***** Example *****

The following entry in file LL-ddeevviicceess specifies a 1200-baud Hayes
(or Hayes-compatible) modem attached to serial port COM2:
