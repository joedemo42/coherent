The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.  The  function smult
multiplies the multiple-precision integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to by
a by the integer n, which  is <= 127.  It writes the product into
the mmiinntt pointed to by c.
