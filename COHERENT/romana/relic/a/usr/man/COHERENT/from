from prints  a list of  integers on the standard  output, one per
line.  It prints beginning with start, and then prints successive
numbers incrementing by  incr (default, one) the previous number.
It continues  until the generated value  matches or exceeds stop.
Each of start, stop, and  optional incr is a decimal integer with
an optional leading `-' sign.

Typical uses  of from  include generating  a file of  numbers and
generating a loop index  for the shell sh.  The following example
creates special files for eight terminal ports:


for i in `from 0 to 7`
do
        /etc/mknod /dev/tty3$i c 3 $i
done
