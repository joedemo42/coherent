Library of miscellaneous functions


misc  is a  collection of library  routines.  These  routines are
useful  for  handling such  programming  tasks  as allocation  of
memory,  copying of  strings,  displaying variables  from C  with
COBOL-like ``picture''  descriptions, and supporting  virtual ar-
rays via secondary storage.

Source code for the library is kept in the compressed tar archive
file /usr/src/alien/misc.tar.Z.  To  extract the files into a new
subdirectory called misc, use the command:


        zcat /usr/src/alien/misc.tar.Z | tar xvf -


To build the library, type the following:


        cd misc
        make


For  a full  description of each  function, consult  the included
Read_me file.
