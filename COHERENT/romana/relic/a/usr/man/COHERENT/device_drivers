device drivers               Overview              device drivers




A device driver  is a program that controls the  action of one of
the physical devices attached to your computer system.

The following  table lists the device  drivers included with this
edition  of  the  COHERENT system.   The  first  field gives  the
device's major device number;  the second gives its name; and the
third describes it.  When a major device number has no driver as-
sociated with it, that device is available for a driver yet to be
written.
