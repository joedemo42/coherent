lpskip                       Command                       lpskip




Terminate/restart current line printer listing

llppsskkiipp [-rr]

The command lpskip aborts or restarts the printing of a file.  By
default, lpskip aborts  the current listing and prints a diagnos-
tic message.   When invoked with  the -r option,  it restarts the
current listing.   This is useful when a  printing is spoiled due
to, say, a paper jam.

lpskip works  only with files that have been  spooled to the line
printer via the command lpr.
