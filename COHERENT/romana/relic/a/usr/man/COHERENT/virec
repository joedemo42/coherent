Recover the modified version of a file after a crash

vviirreecc [-dd _t_m_p_d_i_r] _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e...
vviirreecc </tmp/elv_X_X_X

vviirreecc extracts the most recent version of a text file from a tem-
porary file in /tmp.

When you edit a file with elvis, only about five kilobytes of the
file are  stored in RAM;  the rest is  stored in a  file in /tmp.
vviirreecc extracts the ``undo'' version from the file stored in /tmp.
This is  most useful  when the system  (or elvis) crashes  in the
middle of  a long editing session, since  the ``undo'' version of
the file contains everything except your last change.

There are two ways to use virec.  The first, and most common, way
to  invoke virec  is to  give it  the name of  the file  you were
editing; it finds the matching file in /tmp and writes the newest
available version of the file over the existing version.  It then
deletes the /tmp file.

The second way  is to use the `<' to  let virec read a particular
/tmp file  via stdin.  Use this method when  you either have for-
gotten which file you were  editing and want to see its contents,
or when you wish to recover a file without losing either the /tmp
file or the current version of the text file.

The -d option tells virec to  look for a temporary file in direc-
tory rather than in /tmp.
