Uncompress a compressed file

uunnccoommpprreessss [ -ww _t_e_m_p_f_i_l_e ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

uncompress  uncompressses one  or more files  that had  been com-
pressed by the command compress.

Each file's name must have the suffix .Z, which was appended onto
it by compress; otherwise, uncompress prints an error message and
exits.  When  uncompress has uncompressed a  file, it removes the
.ZZ suffix from that file's name.

If no  file is specified  on the command  line, uncompress uncom-
presses matter read from  the standard input, and writes its out-
put to the standard output.

Older versions of uncompress could only uncompress files that had
been compressed  with option -b12  or lower, with  -b12 being the
default.  The  edition of uncompress released  with COHERENT ver-
sion  3.1  now  handles values  up  to  16  by  using RAM  device
/dev/ram1 for temporary storage.  For this reason, it is strongly
advised that you not use /dev/ram1 as a RAM disk.

The -w  option allows the user to  specify an alternate temporary
storage file to  uncompress.  The default value for tempfile when
the -w option is omitted is /dev/ram1.
