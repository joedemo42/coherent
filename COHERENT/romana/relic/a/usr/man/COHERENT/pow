Raise multiple-precision integer to power

#include <mprec.h>

mmiinntt *_a, *_b, *_m, *_c;

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to perform multiple-precision mathematics.  The function pow sets
the multiple-precision  integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to  by c to the
value pointed to by a raised to the power of the value pointed to
by b, reduced modulo of the value pointed to by m.
