Clear i-node

clri zeroes  out each i-node with a  given inumber on filesystem.
filesystem  is  almost always  a  device-special  file that  cor-
responds to a disk device.  The raw device should be used.

The user  must have read and write  permission on the filesystem.
If the inumber  corresponds to an open file, the  clri has a very
high probability  of being  ineffective: the system  maintains in
core  memory a  copy of  all active i-nodes,  and this  copy will
eventually be  written out to disk, undoing  the effects of clri.
To counter  this problem, unmount the  file system before running
clri.  If the i-node is for the root file system, you must reboot
the system immediately after running clri.
