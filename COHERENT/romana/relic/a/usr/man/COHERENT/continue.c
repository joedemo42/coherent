Terminate current iteration of shell construct

ccoonnttiinnuuee [ _n ]

The command continue helps  to control the flow of commands given
to the  shell sh.  When it is used  without an argument, continue
terminates the  execution of the current  iteration of the inner-
most for, until, or while  shell construct; that is, it acts like
a branch  to the enclosing  done, after which  loop execution may
continue or  terminate.  If an  argument is given,  continue ter-
minates the current iteration of the nth enclosing for, until, or
while loop.

The shell executes continue directly.
