Produce a word list

pprreepp [ -ddffpp ] [ -ii _i_f_i_l_e ] [ -oo _o_f_i_l_e ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

The command prep prepares a  word list that is useful for statis-
tical processing from the  textual data found in each input file.
If no file is given, prep reads the standard input for text.

For the  purposes of  prep, a  word consists of  a string  of al-
phabetic  letters and  apostrophes.  Words  are written,  one per
line, to  the standard output.   Hyphenated words are  treated as
two  words.  However,  any word hyphenated  between two  lines is
rejoined as one word.

prep recognizes the following options:

-dd   Print a sequence number  (of words in the input text) before
     each output word.

-ff   Fold upper-case  letters into lower case.  This is sometimes
     useful for producing unique lists of words.

-ii _i_f_i_l_e
     Ignore words  found in ifile.  ifile has  words one per line
     that are matched again each input word independent of case.

-oo _o_f_i_l_e
     Print only words  found in ofile.  Only one of  -i or -o may
     be specified.

-pp   In  addition to printing words,  also print each punctuation
     character (printable,  non-numeric characters  that separate
     words), one per line.  These lines are not counted for -d.
