Print who is logged in

wwhhoo [_f_i_l_e] [aamm ii]

The command who  prints the names of the users  who are logged in
to  the system.   For each  user, who  prints his  name, terminal
name, login  date, and login time.  The form  who prints this in-
formation only about yourself.

If file is specified, who  uses it instead of /etc/utmp to obtain
information about who is logged in.  This is useful, for example,
with the  file /usr/adm/wtmp, which contains  a continuous record
of logins, logouts and reboots.  When file is specified, who dis-
plays logouts; otherwise, they are suppressed.
