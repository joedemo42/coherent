The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  sdiv
divides the multiple-precision  integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to by a
with the  integer n,  which is in  the range 1  <= _n <=  128.  It
writes  the  quotient into  the  mmiinntt  pointed to  by  q and  the
remainder into the integer pointed to by ip.
