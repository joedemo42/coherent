Convert file system block number to long integer

ll33ttooll(_l_p, _l_3_p, _n)

To conserve  space inside i-nodes  in COHERENT file  systems, the
system  stores block  addresses  in three  bytes.  Programs  that
reference or  maintain file systems  use the functions  l3tol and
ltol3 routines  to convert between  the three-byte representation
and long numbers.

l3tol converts n three-byte block addresses at location l3p to an
array of long integers at location lp.
