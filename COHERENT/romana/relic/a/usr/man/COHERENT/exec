Execute command directly

The shell sh normally  executes commands with a fork system call,
which creates a new process.  The shell command exec directly ex-
ecutes the given command with an exec system call instead.  Norm-
ally, this terminates execution of the current shell.

If the  command consists  only of redirection  specifications, as
described in  sh, exec redirects the input or  output of the cur-
rent shell accordingly without terminating it.  If the command is
omitted, exec has no effect.
