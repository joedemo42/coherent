getwd()                  General Function                 getwd()




Get current working directory name

cchhaarr *ggeettwwdd()

The current  working directory is  the directory from  which file
name searches  commence when a pathname does  not begin with `/'.
getwd returns  the name of the current  working directory.  It is
useful  for processes  that need to  generate full  pathnames for
files, such as spoolers and daemons.

If the  invoker does not have permission to  search all levels of
directory hierarchy  above the current directory,  getwd will not
be able to obtain the directory name.

chdir(), general functions, pwd

***** Diagnostics *****

getwd returns NULL if the current directory cannot be found.

***** Notes *****

The return value points to a  static area that is limited in size
to 400 characters.  getwd will fail if the current directory name
is longer.

The working directory may not be restored to its initial value if
getwd fails.
