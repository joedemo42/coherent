Define n.out file structure

#include <n.out.h>

n.out.h defines the n.out file structure.  This file structure is
used to  encode executable files; it is the  same as the standard
COHERENT form l.out, except that it uses 32-bit addressing.  This
file structure is used  internally in COHERENT, but is not avail-
able under the COHERENT C compiler or assembler.
