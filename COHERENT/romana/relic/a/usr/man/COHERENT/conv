Numeric base converter

conv converts number  to hexadecimal, decimal, octal, binary, and
ASCII characters, and  prints the results on the standard output.
If no  number is given, conv  reads one number per  line from the
standard input until you type the end-of-file character <ccttrrll-DD>.

number may be  in hexadecimal, decimal, octal, binary, or charac-
ter format, as  shown below.  Each example represents the decimal
number 97.

conv  represents an  ASCII  control character  in  its output  by
preceding the  character by a carat `^'.   For example, it prints
<ctrl-X> as `^X'.  conv prints ``bad digit'' if anything is wrong
with the input.

***** Notes *****

conv represents  the input number  internally as a  long integer.
If number does not fit in a long, conv silently truncates it.
