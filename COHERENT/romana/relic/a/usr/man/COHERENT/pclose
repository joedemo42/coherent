pclose()                  STDIO Function                 pclose()




Close a pipe

#include <stdio.h>
iinntt ppcclloossee(_f_p)
FFIILLEE *_f_p;

pclose closes  the pipe  pointed to by  fp, which must  have been
opened by the function popen.

pclose awaits  the completion of  the child process  and performs
other  cleanup.  It  returns the  value from a  WAIT done  on the
child process.   This value  includes information in  addition to
the ``simple'' exit value of the child process.

pclose returns -1 if fp had  not been created by a call to popen.
Otherwise, pclose returns the  exit status of the command, in the
format described  in the entry for wait: exit  status in the high
byte, signal information in the low byte.
