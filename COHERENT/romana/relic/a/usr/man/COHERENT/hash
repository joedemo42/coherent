hash                         Command                         hash




Add a command to the shell's hash table

hhaasshh [-rr] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ... ]

The  command hhaasshh  lets you manipulate  the Korn  shell's hashing
facility.   A hashed  command can  be  accessed instantly  by the
shell, without the delay of searching the directories in the PPAATTHH
environmental variable.

When called  with an argument,  hhaasshh prints all  hashed commands.
When called  with one or more _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  arguments, it adds _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
to its  hash table.  The option -rr removes  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d from the hash
table.

Note  that before  you  can use  hashing,  you must  use the  sseett
command to turn it on.   For more information on the Korn shell's
hashing feature, see the Lexicon entry for kksshh.
