Set file creation mask

umask allows a process to  restrict the mode of files it creates.
Commands that create  files should specify the maximum reasonable
mode.   A  parent (e.g.  the  shell sh)  usually  calls umask  to
restrict access to files created by subsequent commands.

mask should be constructed  from any of the permission bits found
in chmod (the low-order nine  bits).  When a file is created with
creat or  mknod, the bits  specified by mask are  zeroed in mode;
thus, bits set in mask specify permissions which will be denied.

umask returns the old value of the file creation mask.
