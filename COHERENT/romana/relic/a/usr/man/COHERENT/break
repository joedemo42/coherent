break                        Command                        break




Exit from shell construct

bbrreeaakk [ _n ]

The command  break is used  with the shell  sh to control  how it
performs loops.  It is analogous to the break keyword in C.

When it is used without an argument, break forces sh to exit from
the innermost current for, until, or while loop.  If used with an
argument,  break exits  from  n levels  of for,  until, or  while
loops.

sh executes break directly.
