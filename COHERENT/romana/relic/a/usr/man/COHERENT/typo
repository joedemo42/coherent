Detect possible typographical and spelling errors

ttyyppoo [-nnrrss][_f_i_l_e ...]

typo  proofreads an  English-language document  for typographical
errors.   It conducts  a statistical test  of letter  digrams and
trigrams in  each input word against  digram and trigram frequen-
cies throughout  the entire document.  From  this test, typo com-
putes an  index of peculiarity for each word  in the document.  A
high index indicates a word less like other words in the document
than does a  low index.  Built-in frequency tables ensure reason-
able results even for relatively short documents.

typo reads  each input file (or the standard  input if none), and
removes  punctuation and non-alphabetic  characters to  produce a
list of the  words in the document.  To reduce  the volume of the
output,  typo compares  each word against  a small  dictionary of
technical words and discards it if found.  The output consists of
a list  of unique non-dictionary  words with associated  index of
peculiarity, most  peculiar first.  An index  higher than ten in-
dicates that  the word almost  certainly occurs only  once in the
document.

typo recognizes the following arguments:

-nn    Inhibit use  of  the built-in  English  digram and  trigram
     statistics, and inhibit dictionary screening of words.  More
     words will be output  and the indices of peculiarity will be
     less useful for short documents.

-rr    Inhibit the  default stripping  of nroff  escape sequences.
     Normally, typo  strips lines beginning with  `.' and removes
     the nroff escape sequences `\'.

-ss    Produce output  files  digrams and  trigrams that  contain,
     respectively,  the digram  and trigram  frequency statistics
     for the given  document.  No indices of peculiarity are cal-
     culated  or printed.   If desired,  these  files may  be in-
     stalled in directory /usr/dict.
