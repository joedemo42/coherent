pipe                        Definition                       pipe




A pipe  directs the output  stream of one program  into the input
stream of  another program, thus coupling  the programs together.
With  pipes, two  or more  programs (or  _f_i_l_t_e_r_s) can  be coupled
together to  perform complex transforms on  streams of data.  For
example, in the following command


        cat DATAFILE1 DATAFILE2 | sort | uniq -d


the filter  cat opens two  files and prints  their contents.  Its
output is  piped to the filter sort, which  sorts it.  The output
of sort is piped, in turn, to the filter uniq, which (with the -dd
option)  prints a  single copy  of each  line that  is duplicated
within  the file.   Thus, with  this simple  set of  commands and
pipes, a user  can quickly print a list of  all lines that appear
in both files.
