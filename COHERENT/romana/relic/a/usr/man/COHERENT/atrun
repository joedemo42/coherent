Execute commands at a preset time


atrun is  a program that executes  programs at a time  set by the
command at.

When user steve types


        at 1230 /v/steve/lunchtime


the command at  creates a shell script in directory /usr/spool/at
that   contains  the  information   needed  to   execute  command
/v/steve/lunchtime at  a later time  -- in this  instance, 12:30.
The  spooled file sits   /usr/spool/at until  /usr/lib/atrun sees
that the  specified time has  been reached, then  it executes the
spooled command and removes the entry from /usr/spool/at.

atrun is not a daemon; that is, it is invoked by another program,
does its work and  exits.  Thus, it is typically run periodically
from an  entry in the file /usr/lib/crontab.   See the article on
at for more details.

Although  atrun  technically  is  a  command,  is  never  invoked
directly by a user.
