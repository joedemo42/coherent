File systems to check when booting COHERENT

/eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt

The  file /eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt  names all  COHERENT partitions  on your
hard disk.   COHERENT executes ffsscckk  for each file  named in this
file.   This ensures  that the file-system  of each  partition is
checked and cleaned before it is mounted.

When you add a new  COHERENT partition to your system, you should
insert  its name  (that  is, the  name  of its  raw device)  into
/eettcc/cchheecckklliisstt to ensure that  its file system is checked at boot
time.
