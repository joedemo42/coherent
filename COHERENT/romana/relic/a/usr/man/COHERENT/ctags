Generate tags and refs files for elvis editor

ccttaaggss [-rr] _f_i_l_e_s...

ccttaaggss generates the files tags  and refs from a group of C-source
files.  tags is used by the elvis editor's :ttaagg command, <ccttrrll-]>
command, and -tt option.  refs is used by the command rreeff.

Each C-source  file is scanned for  #define statements and global
function definitions.  The  name of the macro or function becomes
the name of a tag.  For  each tag, a line is added to tags, which
contains the following:


             - the name of the tag
             - a tab character
             - the name of the file containing the tag
             - a tab character
             - a way to find the particular line within the file


refs is used by the command rreeff, which can be invoked via elvis's
K  command.  When  ctags finds a  global function  definition, it
copies the  function header into  refs.  The first  line is flush
against the  right margin, but  the argument definitions  are in-
dented.   The command  ref can  search refs  much faster  than it
could search all  C-source files.  The file-names list will typi-
cally  include the  names of  all C-source  files in  the current
directory, in the following format:


$ ctags -r *.[ch]


The -rr to ctags tells it to generate both tags and refs.  Without
-rr, it generates only tags.

***** Notes *****

This version of ctags does  not parse ANSI source code very well.
It has trouble recognizing the ANSI function definitions.
