superuser                   Definition                  superuser




The superuser  is the user  who has system-wide  permissions.  He
can execute any program, read any file, and write into any direc-
tory.   Thus, superuser  status  is reserved  to  the system  ad-
ministrator, also  called root, who needs  this status to control
the operation of the system.

No person should be  able to become the superuser without knowing
a password.  Because the superuser in effect ``owns'' the system,
the superuser password should be guarded most carefully.
