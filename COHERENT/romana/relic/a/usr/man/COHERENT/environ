Process environment


extern char **environ;

environ  is an  array  of strings,  called the  environment of  a
process.  By convention, each string has the form


             _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e


Normally,  each process  inherits the  environment of  its parent
process.  The  shell sh and various forms of  exec can change the
environment.  The  shell adds  the name  and value of  each shell
variable marked for  export to the environment of subsequent com-
mands.  The  shell adds assignments  given on the same  line as a
command to the environment of the command, without affecting sub-
sequent commands.
