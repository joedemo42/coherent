File system dump

dduummpp [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]

dump dumps  either all  or a portion  of file system  argument to
magnetic tape or floppy disks.  File-system dumps are in a format
that  permits you  to restore  all or  some of  the files  to the
original file system, and to select files either by name or by i-
number.

A  file-system dump  includes all  files  changed since  the dump
since date,  plus each file's full path name  (for the benefit of
dumpdir).

options specifies both the dump-since date and the processing op-
tions.    It   is   made   up   of   characters  from   the   set
0123456789bdfsSuv, which have the following meanings.

00-99 The digit gives the level number of the dump.  The dump-since
    date is the most recent date in the dump-date file /etc/ddate
    that is  (1) associated with  this file system and  (2) has a
    level number less  than the current dump level.  For example,
    if you  request a level-3  dump, dduummpp will back  up all files
    not backed up since the last level-2 dump.  A level-0 dump by
    definition backs up all files in the file system.

bb   The  next argument gives  the output tape's  _b_l_o_c_k_i_n_g _f_a_c_t_o_r.
    The blocking  factor is the number  of dduummppddaattaa structures in
    each tape block.  The default blocking factor is 20.

dd   The  next argument  gives the density  of the output  tape in
    bytes per  inch.  The default density is  1600 bytes per inch
    (bpi).  dump uses the density to compute the quantity of tape
    needed.

ff   The next argument gives the path name of the output file.  If
    no f option is given, /dev/dump is assumed.

ss   The next argument gives the  length of the dump tape in feet.
    dump keeps  a running  total of the  quantity of tape  it has
    written, and  it asks for a  new reel if it  appears that the
    end of the reel is near.  The default length is 2,300 feet.

SS   The  next argument gives the size of  the dump output device,
    in blocks.  This is used only  if you are backing up the file
    system  to floppy  disks or  streaming cartridge  tape rather
    than to nine-track magnetic tape.

uu   If  the dump  completes without  error, update the  record of
    successful dumps kept  in file /etc/ddate.  There is an entry
    in this file for every file system and every dump level.

vv   Inform  the user of the  `dump since' date and  the length of
    tape used  in feet.  The  length is useful  for computing the

    quantity of tape remaining if multiple dumps are written onto
    a single reel of tape.

If no level number is given, dump assumes the options 9u.
