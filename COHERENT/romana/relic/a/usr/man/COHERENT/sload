The COHERENT system accesses all devices through drivers residing
in the  system.  Except for the root device,  drivers must be ex-
plicitly loaded  before use; this operation  does not involve re-
booting.

sload  loads the  driver given  by file  as device  number major.
This number  uniquely identifies the driver  to the system.  conp
is a reference to a CON  structure, as defined in the header file
con.h.  It describes standard entry points and gives other infor-
mation on the driver.  Normally, major and conp are obtained from
the driver load module; this is  the method used by the load com-
mand.

file must be in the correct format.  Usually, it is created using
the -k option to ld.

This call is restricted to the superuser.
