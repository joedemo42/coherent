Log in or change user name

The COHERENT system normally invokes  login as part of the log in
sequence on  an unused terminal.  The user  may also invoke login
directly from the shell sh, usually to change to a different user
name.  If  username is not  present, login prompts  the user.  If
the account has a password, login asks for it.

If  the user  logs  in successfully,  login then  reads the  file
/etc/motd (which holds the ``message of the day'') and prints its
contents  on  the screen,   then  notifies the  user  if mail  is
waiting to  be read.  It  then sets the working  directory to the
user's base  directory and sets the user id  and group id, trans-
fers ownership of the tty to  the user, and updates the login ac-
counting   file.   Finally,   if  a   program  is   specified  in
/etc/passwd, login  reads /etc/profile for  lines beginning ``ex-
port'', inserts  the remainder of the  line into the environment,
then  executes the  specified program.  If  the program  field is
blank,  login  executes   sh,  which  executes  the  contents  of
$HOME/.profile if it is present.

From the shell, a user may log in by typing login or by typing an
end of file (normally <ctrl-D>) to terminate the previous shell.

When the superuser rroooott logs in, login sets HHOOMMEE to `/' and reads
the file /.profile should one exist.
