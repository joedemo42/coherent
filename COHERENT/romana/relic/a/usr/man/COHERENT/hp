Prepare files for Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer

hhpp [ -aaccffllrr ] [ -ii_m_a_r_g ] [ -tt_t_o_p ] [ -pp_l_i_n_e_s ] [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

The  command hhpp  translates  nnrrooffff font  specifications into  the
correct escape  sequences for an HP  LaserJet compatible printer.
It  also  allows  the  user  to  set  indentation,  page  length,
landscape mode, and  so on.  Because some LaserJet printers stack
pages in reverse order as they  are printed, hhpp can put pages out
in reverse order.

hhpp recognizes the following options:

-ff     Print pages in the normal order.  This is the default.

-ii_m_a_r_g Set the page indentation to _m_a_r_g.

-ll     Print pages in landscape mode.

-pp_l_i_n_e_s
       Set the page length to _l_i_n_e_s.

-rr     Print pages in reverse order (for LaserJet I).

-tt_t_o_p  Set the top margin to _t_o_p.
