bind                         Command                         bind




Bind key sequence to editing command

bbiinndd [-mm] [_s_t_r_i_n_g [= _c_o_m_m_a_n_d]]

The command bbiinndd is used by the Korn shell kksshh to bind one of its
command-line  editing  commands to  a  given  key sequence.   The
editing commands are  used by kksshh to perform its MicroEMACS-style
command-line editing.

When bbiinndd is invoked  without arguments, it lists on the standard
output all current bindings.

When invoked  with the syntax  _s_t_r_i_n_g=_c_o_m_m_a_n_d, it binds  the key-
sequence _s_t_r_i_n_g to the command.  For example, the command


        bind ^[X=end-of-line


binds the editing  command eenndd-ooff-lliinnee (which moves the cursor to
the end  of the command line) with the  key sequence <eesscc>XX. Note
that <eesscc> is written ^[ -- that is, a literal carat `^' followed
by `['.

When invoked with the syntax -mm _s_t_r_i_n_g=_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s , _s_t_r_i_n_g is bound
to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s,  which contains one or  more editing commands.  This
form  of the  bbiinndd command  lets you  build keyboard  macros that
combine several editing commands into one keystroke sequence.

For  the list  of editing commands,  their default  bindings, and
other details of using MicroEMACS-style command-line editing, see
the Lexicon entry for kksshh.
