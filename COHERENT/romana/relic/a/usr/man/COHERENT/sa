Process accounting

One of the accounting mechanisms available on the COHERENT system
is  process  accounting  (also  called shell  accounting),  which
records the  commands executed by each  user.  The command accton
enables or disables shell accounting.

The  command sa  scans  the accounting  information  in file  and
prints  a  summary.   If  file  is  omitted, it  reads  the  file
/usr/adm/acct by  default.  For each command  executed, sa prints
the number  of calls made, the total CPU  time (user and system),
and the total real time.  The output is ordered by decreasing CPU
time.

sa recognizes the following options:

aa   Place commands executed  only once and command names with un-
    printable characters in the category ``***other''.

bb   Sort by average CPU time per call.

cc   Also print CPU time as a percentage of all CPU time used.

jj   Print average times per call rather than totals.

ll   Separate user and system time.

mm   Accumulate information for each user rather for each command.

nn   Sort by number of calls.

rr   Reverse the order of the sort.

ss    After scanning,  condense the accounting  file and  merge it
    into the summary files.

tt   Also print the CPU time as a percentage of real time.

uu   Print  the user and command for  each accounting record; this
    option overrides all others.

vv _N For commands called no more than N times, where N is a digit,
    sa  asks  whether  to  place  the  command  in  the  category
    ``**junk**''.

sa uses  the summary files  /usr/adm/savacct and /usr/adm/usracct
to lessen disk usage.

***** Notes *****

The  file /usr/adm/acct  can  become very  large; therefore,  you
should truncate it periodically.  Special care should be taken if
process accounting  is enabled on a  COHERENT system with limited
disk space.
