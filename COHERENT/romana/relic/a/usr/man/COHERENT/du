du                           Command                           du




Summarize disk usage

dduu [-aa] [-ss] [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ...]

du  prints the  total number  of disk blocks  used by  each named
directory.   If no  directory is  specified,  du prints  the disk
usage of the current directory.

The -a (all) option causes du  to print a line for every file and
directory in  the substructure.  Normally  it prints a  line only
for each directory.

The -s  (summary) option prints  only the line for  the top level
directory.

du understands links;  it adds a file with more  than one link to
it into the total only once.

***** Notes *****

du does  not count file-system overhead  such as indirect blocks,
so occasionally  a directory does not fit on  a file system which
appears to contain enough room for it.
