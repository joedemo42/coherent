check                        Command                        check




Check file system

cchheecckk [-ss] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...

check uses  the commands icheck  and dcheck to  check the consis-
tency of  a file system.  It acts on  each argument filesystem in
turn; it  calls first  icheck and then  dcheck on each  to detect
problems.

If -s is specified, check attempts to repair any errors automati-
cally.  You  should first unmount  the file system,  if possible.
If the root device is involved, you should be in single-user mode
and then reboot the system immediately (without typing sync).

***** Notes *****

Certain  errors,  such  as  duplicated  blocks, cannot  be  fixed
automatically.  Decisions must be made by a human.

In earlier releases of  COHERENT, check acted upon a default file
system if none was specified.

This command has largely been superceded by fsck.
