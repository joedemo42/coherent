Device numbering


A  major number  specifies the  device  driver associated  with a
given device  name found in the directory  /dev.  COHERENT uses a
device's the  major number as an index into  an internal table of
device-driver pointers.

Every  COHERENT device  has a device  number associated  with it.
This device number is of type dev_t, as defined in <sys/types.h>.
The macro major()  in <sys/stat.h> extracts the major number from
a given device number.
