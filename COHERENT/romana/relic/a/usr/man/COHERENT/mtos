Convert multiple-precision integer to string

cchhaarr *mmttooss(_a) mmiinntt *_a;

The COHERENT  system includes a suite of  routines that allow you
to  perform multiple-precision  mathematics.   The function  mtos
converts the multiple-precision integer (or mmiinntt) pointed to by a
to a string.  It returns a pointer to the string it creates.  The
string is  allocated by  malloc, and may  be freed by  free.  The
base of the  string is set by the value  of the external variable
obase.
