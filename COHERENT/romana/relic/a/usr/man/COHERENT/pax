Portable archive interchange


ppaaxx is  an archiving utility  that reads and writes  ttaarr and ccppiioo
formats,  both  the traditional  ones  and  the extended  formats
specified  in  IEEE  document  1003.1.   It handles  multi-volume
archives and  automatically determines  the format  of an archive
while reading it.

ppaaxx supports  three user interfaces: ttaarr, ccppiioo,  and ppaaxx. The ppaaxx
interface was  designed by  IEEE  1003.2  as a compromise  in the
chronic  controversy over  which of  ttaarr  or  ccppiioo  interfaces is
superior.

***** Notes *****

To avoid confusion with the traditional COHERENT ttaarr command, the
ttaarr command distributed with ppaaxx is renamed uussttaarr.

See the compressed  ttaarr archive /uussrr/ssrrcc/aalliieenn/ppaaxx.ttaarr.ZZ for full
documentation on ppaaxx, ccppiioo, and uussttaarr.
