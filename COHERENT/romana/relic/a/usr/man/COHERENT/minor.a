Device numbering


A minor  number specifies  the device or  type of device  to use.
COHERENT uses  the minor  number of a  given device in  a driver-
specific  manner.  For  example, a hard-disk  driver may  use the
minor number to select a disk drive and partition.

Every COHERENT device has a device number associated with it.  It
is of type dev_t, as defined in <sys/types.h>.  The macro minor()
in  <sys/stat.h> extracts  the minor number  from a  given device
number.
