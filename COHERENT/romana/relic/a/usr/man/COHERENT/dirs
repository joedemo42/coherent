Print the contents of the directory stack

ddiirrss

The COHERENT shell  sshh maintains an internal ``directory stack'',
which is  a stack  of names  of directories.  You  can manipulate
this stack should you, for  any reason, wish to traverse a number
of directories quickly and efficiently.

The  command ddiirrss  prints the current  contents of  the directory
stack.
