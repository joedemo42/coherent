ncheck                       Command                       ncheck




Print file names corresponding to i-numbers

nncchheecckk [ ii _n_u_m_b_e_r ... ] [ -aass ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...

An  i-number identifies  an i-node.  ncheck  generates a  list of
file names  by i-number for each filesystem,  which should be the
name of  a device  special file  that contains a  proper COHERENT
file system.   Using the raw device  generally decreases the time
ncheck requires to do its work.

The output is in the  unsorted traversal order of the file system
hierarchy.  ncheck  distinguishes directories from  files by suf-
fixing `/.' to directory names.

Under the -i option, ncheck prints the file name corresponding to
each i-number  number in  the given  list.  Under the  -a option,
ncheck prints  only the  names of  special files and  set user-ID
mode files; this option allows the system administrator to ascer-
tain  quickly  whether these  files  represent possible  security
breaches.

***** Diagnostics *****

ncheck appends `??' to the  generated file name if it cannot find
the proper parent structure while retrieving the file-name infor-
mation.  It represents any loops detected in the file name by the
characters  `...'.  Extremely  addled file  systems  may generate
other reasonably self-explanatory diagnostics.
