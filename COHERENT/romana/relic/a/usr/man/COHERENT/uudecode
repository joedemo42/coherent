uudecode                     Command                     uudecode




Decode a binary file sent from a remote system

uuuuddeeccooddee [ _f_i_l_e ]

uudecode takes a file  encoded by uuencode and translates it back
to binary.  Any leading and trailing lines added by uucp are dis-
carded.

If the file is not specified, standard input is read.

***** Example *****

Consider the file tmp consisting of:


        begin 644 sys
        M5&AE('%U:6-K(&)R;W=N(&9O>"!J=6UP<R!O=F5R('1H92!L87IY(&1O9RX*

        end


Note that  the third line is  a space followed by  a newline.  To
decode it, type:


        uudecode tmp


The output contained in file ssyyss will be:


     The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
