Shut down the COHERENT system

/etc/shutdown

shutdown shuts  down the COHERENT  system.  It is  a shell script
that leads  you through each  step of system  shutdown.  Only the
superuser rroooott  can run shutdown.   When shut down  has been com-
pleted,  the COHERENT  system is  in  single-user mode.   At this
point, the  user can safely run fsck, reboot  the system, or turn
the computer off.

Failure to shut down  the system before rebooting or shutting off
the computer  could damage the  COHERENT file system  and destroy
data.
