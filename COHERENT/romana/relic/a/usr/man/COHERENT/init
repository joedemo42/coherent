System initialization

/etc/init

The COHERENT boot procedure executes init as process 1 to perform
initialization.  init opens the console terminal /dev/console and
invokes the shell script /etc/brc  if it exists.  If it does not,
init invokes a  shell sh on it with HOME  set to /etc.  The shell
executes /etc/profile  and /etc/.profile if  present.  The system
then runs in single-user  mode and accepts commands from the con-
sole.

When the console  terminates the shell, normally by typing <ctrl-
D>, init brings up the system in multiuser mode.  It executes the
shell command  file /etc/rc, which  performs standard bookkeeping
and maintenance  chores.  Typically it mounts  standard file sys-
tems, removes  temporary files, and invokes  cron and update.  If
desired, it  may load device drivers,  enable swapping with swap,
and enable process accounting with accton.

Next, init  opens terminals as  specified in the  file /etc/ttys.
It invokes getty to read a  user name and perform a login on each
terminal.

When a user  shell terminates, init updates the system accounting
information in /etc/utmp  and /usr/adm/wtmp.  Then it reopens the
appropriate terminal and invokes getty, as above.

init  rescans  the  file /etc/ttys  for  terminal  changes if  it
receives  the signal  SIGQUIT.   The command  kkiillll  qquuiitt 11  sends
SIGQUIT to  the init process.  init then  invokes getty as neces-
sary.

init returns  the system to  single user mode if  it receives the
signal SIGHUP.   The command kkiillll  -11 11 sends SIGHUP  to the init
process.
