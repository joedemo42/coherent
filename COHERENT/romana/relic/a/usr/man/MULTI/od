Print an octal dump of a file

oodd [-bbccddooxx] [_f_i_l_e] [ [+] _o_f_f_s_e_t[.][bb] ]

od prints  the specified file as a sequence  of octal numbers, or
machine words.   If no file  is specified, od  dumps the standard
input.

The following options set the format of oodd's output:


             -bb      Bytes in default base
             -cc      Bytes in ASCII characters
             -dd      Words in decimal
             -oo      Words in octal
             -xx      Words in hexadecimal


The default  base is octal  on the PDP-11 and  hexadecimal on the
i8086, Z-8001, and M68000 families of microprocessors.

Dumping  can  start  at  position  offset  into  the  file.   The
specified offset  is octal  unless the  `.' suffix is  present to
signify  decimal.  offset  is  in bytes  unless the  b suffix  is
present to signify 512-byte blocks.
