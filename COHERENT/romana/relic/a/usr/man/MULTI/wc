Count words, lines, and characters in files

wwcc [-ccllww] [_f_i_l_e...]

wc counts words, lines, and  characters in each file.  If no file
is given, wc  uses the standard input.  If more  than one file is
given, wc also prints a total for all of the files.

wc  defines a  word to  be a string  of characters  surrounded by
white space  (blanks, tabs, or newlines).   It defines the number
of lines to be the number of newline characters in the file, plus
one.

wc recognizes the following options:

-cc Count only characters.

-ll Count only lines.

-ww Count only words.

The default action is to print all counts.
