nm                           Command                           nm




Print a program's symbol table

nnmm [ -aaddggnnoopprrttuuxx ] _f_i_l_e ...

The command  nm prints the symbol table of  each file.  Each file
argument must  be a COHERENT  object module or  an object library
built  with the  archiver aarr.   If an argument  is a  library, nm
prints the symbol table for each member of the library.

The  first  argument  selects  one  of  several options.   It  is
optional; if present, it must begin with `-'.  The options are as
follows:

-aa Print  all symbols.  Normally, nm prints names  that are in C-
   style format and  ignores symbols with names inaccessible from
   C programs.

-dd Print only defined symbol.

-gg Print only global symbols.

-nn Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.  nm uses unsigned
   compares when sorting symbols with this option.

-oo Append the file name to the beginning of each output line.

-pp Print  symbols in  the order in  which they appear  within the
   symbol table.

-rr Sort in reverse-alphabetical order.

-uu Print only undefined symbols.

By default, nm sorts symbol names alphabetically.  Each symbol is
followed by its value and its segment.
