Create a directory

mkdir creates directory.  Files or directories with the same name
as directory must not already exist.  directory will be empty ex-
cept for  the entries  `.', the  directory's link to  itself, and
`..', its  link to its  parent directory.  The  option -r creates
directories recursively.  For example, the command


        mkdir -r /foo/bar/baz


creates directory  foo in  /; then  creates directory bar  in the
newly created directory foo; and finally creates directory baz in
the newly created directory bar.

mkdir fails and  prints an error message if you  do not have per-
mission to  write into directory  in which you  are attempting to
create  a new  directory, or  if the directory  in which  you at-
tempted to create a new directory does not exist.
