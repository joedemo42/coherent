The shell  sshh keeps track of  the directory in which  the user is
currently working.   If a command is not  specified by a complete
path name beginning with `/', sshh prefixes it with the name of the
current working directory.  cd changes the current working direc-
tory to  directory.  If no directory  is specified, the directory
named  in the  $HOME environmental  variable becomes  the current
working directory.
