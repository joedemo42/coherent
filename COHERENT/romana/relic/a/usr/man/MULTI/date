date                         Command                         date




Print/set the date and time

ddaattee [-ss] [-uu] [[_y_y_m_m_d_d]_h_h_m_m[._s_s]]

date prints  the time of day and the  current date, including the
time zone.   If an argument  is given, the  system's current time
and date is changed, as follows:


         _y_y    Year (00-99)
         _m_m    Month (01-12)
         _d_d    Day (01-31)
         _h_h    Hour (00-23)
         _m_m    Minute (00-59)
         _s_s    Seconds (00-59)


The seconds fields are optional.  For example, typing


    date 860512141233


sets the date  to May 12, 1986, and the  time to 2:12:33 P.M.  At
least hh and mm must be specified--the rest are optional.

The date may be changed only by the superuser.

If option -s  is specified, date suppresses daylight savings time
conversion when setting the time.

If option -u is specified, dates are set and printed in Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT) rather than in local time.

The library  time conversion routines  used by date  look for the
environmental variable TIMEZONE,  which specifies local time zone
and daylight  saving time information in  the format described in
ctime.
