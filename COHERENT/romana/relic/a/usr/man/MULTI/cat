cat                          Command                          cat




Concatenate/print files

ccaatt [ -uu ][ _f_i_l_e ... ]

cat copies  each file  arguments to  the standard output.   A `-'
tells cat  to read the standard input.  If  no file is specified,
cat reads the standard input.

The -u option  makes the output unbuffered.  Otherwise, cat buff-
ers the  output in units of the machine's  disk block size (e.g.,
512 bytes).

***** Notes *****

If you  redirect cat's the output  to one of its  input files, it
will loop  forever, reading  from the file  the text that  it has
just written into it: in effect, cat will chase its own tail end-
lessly.
