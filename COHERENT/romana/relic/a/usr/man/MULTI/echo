echo                         Command                         echo




Repeat/expand an argument

eecchhoo [-nn] [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]

eecchhoo prints each _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t on the standard output, placing a space
between each  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t. It  appends a newline  to the end  of the
output unless the -nn flag is present.

eecchhoo recognizes  the following special  character sequences.  For
each occurrence of the sequence, it substitutes the corresponding
ASCII character.


               \b        Backspace
               \c        Print line without a newline (like -nn option)
               \f        Formfeed
               \n        Newline
               \r        Carriage return
               \t        Tab
               \v        Vertical tab
               \\        Backslash
               \_n_n_n      _n_n_n is the octal value of the desired character


 For example, if you type:


          echo 'Please enter your name: \007\c'


the shell prints


          Please enter your name:


on your screen.  Note  that the \000077 sequence causes the terminal
bell to sound, and that  since the \cc sequence was specified, the
cursor will be left positioned after the colon.
