environmental variables      Overview     environmental variables




The  _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t is  a set  of  information that  is read  by all
programs that  run on  your system.  It  consists of one  or more
_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_a_l _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s that  you set.  For example, when you set
the environmental variable  PPAATTHH, you tell COHERENT that you wish
to  pass  this  information  to  all  programs  on  your  system,
including COHERENT itself.

By changing  the environment,  you can  change the way  a command
works without  rewriting any commands that  you may have embedded
in batch files, scripts, or mmaakkeeffiillees.

COHERENT uses  the following  environmental variables to  set its
environment.  The programs that you write may use others that you
define yourself, if you wish.
