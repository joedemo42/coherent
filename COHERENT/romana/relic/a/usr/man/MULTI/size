size                         Command                         size




Print size of an object file

ssiizzee [_f_i_l_e ...]

size prints the sizes, in bytes, of the segments of each file (in
decimal) and  also prints the total size of  all the segments (in
both decimal and octal).  Each file must be an object file.

One line is output for each file, listing the following segments:


             Shared instructions
             Private instructions
             Uninitialized instructions
             Shared data
             Private data
             Uninitialized data


If you specify the -c option,  the total size of the common areas
is displayed immediately after the uninitialized data.
