mv renames  files.  In the first form above,  it changes the name
of oldfile to newfile.  If newfile already exists, mv replaces it
with the file being moved; if  not, mv creates it.  If newfile is
a directory, mv places oldfile under that directory.

In the second  form, mv moves each file so  that it resides under
directory.  If a file with the new name exists but is unwritable,
mv will not delete it unless the -f option is specified.

mv will not copy  directories between devices and will not remove
directories that occupy the destination of the command.

Normally, mv creates a link to the old file with the new file and
then removes  the old file.  If it cannot  create the link (e.g.,
because the new file is on a different file system than the old),
mv performs a copy and then removes the old file.

***** Notes *****

mv tests the validity of  directory moves by means of search per-
mission.  The superuser always has search permission and thus can
use mv incorrectly.
