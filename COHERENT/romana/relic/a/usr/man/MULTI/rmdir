rmdir                        Command                        rmdir




Remove directories

rrmmddiirr [ -ff ] _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ...

rmdir  removes each  directory.  This  will not  be allowed  if a
directory is the current  working directory or is not empty.  The
force option  -f allows the superuser  to override these restric-
tions.   rmdir removes  the `.'  and `..'  entries automatically.
Note that  using the -ff option  on a directory that  is not empty
will damage  the file system,  and require that it  be fixed with
fsck.

***** Notes *****

rmdir  -f does  not remove  files from  a nonempty  directory; it
simply orphans them.  To remove a nonempty directory and its con-
tents, use rm -r instead.
