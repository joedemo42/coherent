Get the current time from the operating system

#include <sys/timeb.h>
ffttiimmee(_t_b_p) ssttrruucctt ttiimmeebb *_t_b_p;

ftime fills  the structure timeb,  which is pointed  to tbp, with
COHERENT's representation of  the current time.  timeb is defined
in the header file timeb.h, as follows:


struct timeb {
        time_t time;
        unsigned short millitm;
        short timezone;
        short dstflag;
}


The member  time is the number of seconds  since January 1, 1970,
0h00m00s GMT.  millitm  is a count of milliseconds.  timezone and
dstflag are obsolete;  they have been replaced by the environmen-
tal variable TIMEZONE.
