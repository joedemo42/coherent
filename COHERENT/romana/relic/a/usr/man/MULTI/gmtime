gmtime()                  Time Function                  gmtime()




Convert system time to calendar structure

#include <time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
ttmm *ggmmttiimmee(_t_i_m_e_p) ttiimmee_tt *_t_i_m_e_p;

gmtime  converts the  internal time  from seconds  since midnight
January 1,  1970 GMT, into  fields that give  integer years since
1900,  the month,  day of  the month, the  hour, the  minute, the
second, the  day of the week, and yearday.   It returns a pointer
to the structure tm, which defines these fields, and which is it-
self  defined in  the  header file  time.h.   Unlike its  cousin,
localtime, gmtime returns Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
