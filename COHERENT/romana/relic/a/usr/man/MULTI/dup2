Duplicate a file descriptor

iinntt dduupp22(_f_d, _n_e_w_f_d) iinntt _f_d, _n_e_w_f_d;

dup2 duplicates  the file descriptor fd.   Unlike its cousin dup,
dup2 allows  you to specify  a new file  descriptor newfd, rather
than having the system select one.  If newfd is already open, the
system  closes it  before  assigning it  to the  new file.   dup2
returns the duplicate descriptor.
