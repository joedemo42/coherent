time                         Overview                        time




COHERENT includes a number of  routines that allow you to set and
manipulate  time,  as  recorded on  the  system's  clock, into  a
variety of formats.  These routines should be adequate for nearly
any task  that involves temporal calculations  or the maintenance
of data gathered over a long period of time.

All functions,  global variables, and manifest  constants used in
connection  with time  are defined  and  described in  the header
files ttiimmee.hh and ttiimmeebb.hh.

The COHERENT  system includes the following  functions to manipu-
late time:


     aassccttiimmee   Convert time structure to ASCII string
     ccttiimmee     Convert system time to an ASCII string
     ffttiimmee     Get the current time from the operating system
     ggmmttiimmee    Convert system time to calendar structure
     llooccaallttiimmee Convert system time to calendar structure
     sseettttzz     Set local time zone
     ttiimmee      Get current time


To print out the local time, a program must perform the following
tasks: First, read the system time with time.  Then, it must pass
time's  output to  localtime, which  breaks it  down into  the tm
structure.   Next, it  must pass  localtime's output  to asctime,
which transforms the tm structure into an ASCII string.  Finally,
it must  pass the output of asctime to  printf, which displays it
on the standard output device.   See the entry for asctime for an
example of such a program.
