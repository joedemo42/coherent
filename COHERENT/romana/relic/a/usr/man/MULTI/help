Print concise description of command

hheellpp _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

help prints  a concise description  of the options  available for
each specifed command.  If  the command is omitted, help prints a
simple description  of itself, followed by  information about the
command given by  $LASTERROR, which is the last command returning
a nonzero exit status.

help provides more  information than the usage message printed by
a command,  but less than  the detailed description  given by the
man  command.  The  primary purpose  of help  is to  refresh your
memory if you have forgotten an option to command.

help prints information normally found between .HS and .HE macros
in the nroff source for the manual pages.  nroff ignores this in-
formation.  If help finds  no information in the manual pages, it
looks in  /etc/helpfile for additional system  information and in
$HELP for user-specific information.  Information about a command
begins with a line


        @_c_o_m_m_a_n_d


and ends  with the next line beginning  with `@' in /etc/helpfile
or $HELP.  help  constructs the index file /etc/helpindex to make
subsequent searches of /etc/helpfile faster.
