PATH                  Environmental Variable                 PATH




Directories that hold executable files


PATH  names a  default set  of directories  that are  searched by
COHERENT when it seeks an executable file.  You can set PATH with
the command PPAATTHH.  For example, typing


        PATH=/bin:/usr/bin


tells COHERENT to search  for executable files first in /bin, and
then  in /usr/bin.   Note the  use of the  colon `:'  to separate
directory names.
