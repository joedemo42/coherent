etext                 Linker-Defined Symbol                 etext



extern int etext[];

etext is  the location after  the shared and  private text (code)
segments.  It is defined by  the linker when it binds the program
together for execution.  The value of etext is merely an address.
The location to which it  points contains no known value, and may
be illegal memory locations  for the program.  The value of etext
does not change while the program is running.

***** Example *****



main()
{
        extern int etext[];
        printf("etext=%ld\n", (long) etext);
}
