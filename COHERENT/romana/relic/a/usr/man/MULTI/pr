Paginate and print files

pprr [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e ...]

pr paginates each named file and sends it to the standard output.
The file name `-' means standard  input.  If no file is named, pr
reads the standard input.

Each page has  a header that gives the date,  file name, and page
and line numbers.  pprr may be used with the following options.

+ _s_k_i_p
     Skip the first skip pages of each input file.

-_N   Print  the text  in N  columns.  This is  used to  print out
     material that was typed in one or more columns.

-hh _h_e_a_d_e_r
     Use  header in  place of  the  text name  in the  title.  If
     _h_e_a_d_e_r is  more than one  word long, it must  be enclosed in
     quotation marks.

-ll_N  Set the page length to N lines (default, 66).

-mm   Print  the texts simultaneously, in  separate columns.  Each
     text will be assigned an  equal amount of width on the page,
     and  any lines  longer than  that  width will  be truncated.
     This  is used  to print  several  similar texts  or listings
     simultaneously.

-nn   Number each line as it is printed.

-ss_c  Separate  each column by the character  c.  You can separate
     columns with  a letter of the alphabet, a  period, or an as-
     terisk.  Normally, each column is left justified in a fixed-
     width field.

-tt   Suppress  the printing of  the header on each  page, and the
     header and footer space.

-ww_N  Set  the page width to N columns  (default, 80).  Text lines
     are truncated to fit the column width.  The maximum width is
     256 columns.
