ccpp [ -dd ]  _o_l_d_n_a_m_e _n_e_w_n_a_m_e

cp copies  files.  In its  first form, cp copies  the contents of
oldname to newname, which it creates if necessary.  If newname is
a directory,  cp copies  oldname to  a file of  the same  name in
directory newfile.

In  its second  form,  cp copies  each file,  from file1  through
fileN, into directory.

With the -d option,  cp preserves the date (modification time) of
the  source  file or  files  on  the target  file  or files.   By
default, target files get the current time.

A file cannot be copied to itself.
