end                   Linker-Defined Symbol                   end



extern int end[];

end is the location  after the uninitialized data segment.  It is
defined by the linker when  it binds the program together for ex-
ecution.  The value of end is merely an address.  The location to
which  it points  contains  no known  value, and  may be  illegal
memory  locations for  the program.   The value  of end  does not
change while the program is running.

***** Example *****



main()
{
        extern int end[];
        printf("end=%lx\n", (long) end);
}
