abort()                  General Function                 abort()




End program immediately

vvooiidd aabboorrtt()

abort  terminates a  process with  a core  dump, creating  a file
called ccoorree, and prints a  message on the screen.  It is normally
invoked in  situations that ``should not  happen''.  For example,
malloc invokes abort if it discovers a corrupt storage arena.

Where possible, abort  executes a machine instruction that causes
the processor to trap.  If the signal associated with the trap is
caught or ignored, the dump will not be produced.
