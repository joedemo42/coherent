manifest constant           Definition          manifest constant




A manifest constant is a numeric constant that is given a name so
it can be  defined differently under different computing environ-
ments.   An example  is EOF,  the  end-of-file marker,  which has
wildly different  representations under different  operating sys-
tems.  Note, too, that numerals are manifest constants by defini-
tion.

The use  of manifest constants  in programs helps  to ensure that
code is portable by isolating the definition of these elements in
a single header file, where they need to be changed only once.
