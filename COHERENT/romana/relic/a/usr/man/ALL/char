char is  a C data type.   It is the smallest  addressable unit of
data.  According to the ANSI Standard, a char consists of exactly
one byte  of storage;  a byte,  in turn, must  be composed  of at
least eight  bits.  ssiizzeeooff(cchhaarr) returns one  by definition, with
all  other data  types defined  as  multiples thereof.   All Mark
Williams compilers  sign-extend char when it is  cast to a larger
data type.

Under COHERENT, a char by default is signed.
