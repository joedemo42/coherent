Wildcards  are  characters   that,  in  some  circumstances,  can
represent a range of  ASCII characters.  Another name for them is
``metacharacters''.  The  wildcards available under  COHERENT are
as follows:

?    Match any one character.

*    Match any number of characters, or no characters at all.

[ ]  A set of characters enclosed between `[' and `]'  will match
     any one  character of the  set.  Sets of  characters may in-
     clude ranges,  such as [aa-zz]  for all lower-case  letters or
     [00-99] for all numerals.

\    Ignore the special meaning of a wildcard.
