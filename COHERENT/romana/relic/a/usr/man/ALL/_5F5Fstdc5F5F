Mark a conforming translator


_ _STDC_ _ is  a preprocessor constant  that is defined  by the C
preprocessor.  If it  is defined to be equal to  one, then it in-
dicates that the translator conforms to the ANSI Standard.

The value  of _ _STDC_ _  remains constant throughout  the entire
program, no  matter how many  source files it  comprises.  It may
not be  the subject of  a #define or  #undef preprocessing direc-
tive.
