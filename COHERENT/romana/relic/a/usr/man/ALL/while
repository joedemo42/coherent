Introduce a loop

while is  a C keyword  that introduces a  conditional loop.  con-
dition is  tested on reiteration  of the loop, and  the loop ends
when condition is no longer satisfied.  For example,


        while (foo < 10)


introduces a  loop that will  continue until the  variable foo is
reset to ten or greater.  Note that the statement


        while (1)


will loop forever, unless interrupted by a break, goto, or return
statement.
