Data type


An int is the most commonly  used numeric data type, and is norm-
ally used  to encode integers.  With  COHERENT, ssiizzeeooff iinntt equals
2, that  is, two cchhaarrs (15  bits plus a sign  bit); therefore, an
int can contain values from -32768 to +32767.  An int normally is
sign extended  when cast to a larger data  type; an unsigned int,
however, will be zero extended.
