External integer for return of error status

extern int errno;

errno  is an  external  integer that  COHERENT  links into  every
program.  COHERENT sets errno  to the negative value of any error
status  returned  by  COHERENT  to  the  functions  that  perform
COHERENT system calls.

Mathematical functions  use errno to  indicate classifications of
errors on  return.  eerrrrnnoo is  defined within the  header file eerr-
rrnnoo.hh.   Because not  every  function uses  errno,  it should  be
polled only in  connection with those functions that document its
use and the meaning of  the various status values.  For the names
of the  error codes (as defined in eerrrrnnoo.hh,  their value, and the
message returned by the function ppeerrrroorr, see errno.h.

entry for aaccooss.
