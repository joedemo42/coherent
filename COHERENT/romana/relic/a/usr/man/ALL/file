A file is a mass of bits that has been given a name and is stored
on a nonvolatile medium.  These bits may form ASCII characters or
machine-executable data.   Under the COHERENT  system and related
operating systems, external devices can mimic files, in that they
can be opened, closed, read, and written to in a manner identical
to that of files.

To manipulate  the contents  of a file,  you must first  open it.
This can be done with the  COHERENT system call open, or with the
function fopen.   You can then  read the file,  write material to
it, or  append material  onto it  with the COHERENT  system calls
rreeaadd and write, or with  the functions ffrreeaadd and ffwwrriittee.  See the
entries on CCOOHHEERREENNTT ssyysstteemm  ccaallllss and entry SSTTDDIIOO for more infor-
mation on manipulating material within a file.
