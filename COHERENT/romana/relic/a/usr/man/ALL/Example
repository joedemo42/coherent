Give an example of Mark Williams Lexicon format

#include <example.h>
cchhaarr *eexxaammppllee(_f_o_o, _b_a_r) iinntt _f_o_o; lloonngg _b_a_r;

This  is  an  example of  the  Mark  Williams  Lexicon format  of
software documentation.   At this point,  each entry has  a brief
narration that discusses the topic in detail.

The  lines in  bboollddffaaccee describe  how to  use the  function being
described.  The first  line, #iinncclluuddee <eexxaammppllee.hh>, indicates that
this function requires  the imaginary header file eexxaammppllee.hh.  The
second  line gives  the syntax  of  the function.   char *example
means that the imaginary  function eexxaammppllee returns a pointer to a
cchhaarr.  foo and bar  are example's arguments: foo must be declared
to be an int, and bar must be declared to be a long.

***** Example *****

The following program gives an example of an example.

***** Notes *****

If a Lexicon  entry uses a technical term that  you do not under-
stand, look it  up in the Lexicon.  In this  way, you will gain a
secure understanding of how to use COHERENT.
