_T_h_e _C  _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e, ed. 2  forbids structure assignment,
the passing of  structures to functions, and returning structures
from  functions  (as  opposed  to  the  passing or  returning  of
_p_o_i_n_t_e_r_s  to structures).   The COHERENT  C compiler  lifts these
restrictions.

Some  C  compilers transform  structure  arguments and  structure
returns into structure  pointers.  Note that the use of structure
assignment, structure arguments,  or structure returns may create
problems when porting the code to another C compiler.

Because this feature deviates  from the description of the C lan-
guage found  in the first edition of  _T_h_e _C _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e,
compiling with  the -VSBOOK option will flag  all points where it
occurs in your program.
