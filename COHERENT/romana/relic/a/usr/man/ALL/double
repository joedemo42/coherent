Data type


A  double  is  the  data  type  that encodes  a  double-precision
floating-point  number.   On  most  machines,  sizeof(double)  is
defined as four machine words,  or eight cchhaarrs.  If you wish your
code to be portable, do _n_o_t  use routines that depend on a double
being 64 bits long.

Different formats are used to encode doubles on various machines.
These  formats  include  IEEE,  DECVAX,  and  BCD  (binary  coded
decimal), as described in the entry for float.
