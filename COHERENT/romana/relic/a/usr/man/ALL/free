free()                   General Function                  free()




Return dynamic memory to free memory pool

vvooiidd ffrreeee(_p_t_r) cchhaarr *_p_t_r;

free helps  you manage the arena.  It returns  to the free memory
pool memory that had previously been allocated by malloc, calloc,
or realloc.  free marks the  block indicated by _p_t_r as unused, so
the malloc  search can coalesce  it with contiguous  free blocks.
ptr must have been obtained from malloc, calloc, or realloc.

***** Example *****

For an  example of  how to  use this routine,  see the  entry for
malloc.

arena, calloc(), general functions, malloc(), realloc(), setbuf()

***** Diagnostics *****

free prints  a message and  calls aabboorrtt if it  discovers that the
arena has been corrupted.  This most often occurs by storing data
beyond the bounds of an allocated block.
