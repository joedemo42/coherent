arena                       Definition                      arena




An arena is the area of memory that is available for a program to
allocate dynamically  at run time.  It  is divided into allocated
and unallocated blocks.  The unallocated blocks together form the
``free memory pool''.

Portions  of  the  arena can  be  allocated  using the  functions
malloc, calloc, or realloc; returned to the free memory pool with
free; or checked to see if they are allocated or not with notmem.
To check  whether the  arena has been  corrupted or not,  use the
function memok.
