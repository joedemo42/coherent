Mark Williams  Company has  written C  compilers for a  number of
different computers.  Each  has a unique architecture and defines
data formats in its own way.

The following table gives the  sizes, in cchhaarrs, of the data types
as they are defined by various microprocessors.

COHERENT places  some alignment restrictions on  data, which con-
form  to all  restrictions set by  the microprocessor.   Byte or-
dering is  set by  the microprocessor;  see the Lexicon  entry on
byte ordering for more information.
