Descriptor for a file stream

#include <stdio.h>

FILE describes a  file stream which can be either  a file on disk
or a peripheral device through which data flow.  It is defined in
the header file stdio.h.

A  pointer to  FILE is  returned by  fopen, freopen,  fdopen, and
related functions.

The FFIILLEE structure is as follows:


        typedef struct  FILE
        {
                unsigned char *_cp,
                              *_dp,
                              *_bp;
                int     _cc;
                int     (*_gt)(),
                        (*_pt)();
                int     _ff;
                char    _fd;
                int     _uc;
        } FILE;


_cp points  to the current character in the  file.  _dp points to
the start of the data within  the buffer.  _bp points to the file
buffer.  _cc is the number of unprocessed characters in the buff-
er.  _gt  and _pt point, respectively, to  the functions getc and
putc.  _ff  is a bit  map that holds  the various file  flags, as
follows:


             _FFIINNUUSSEE 0x01    Unused
             _FFSSTTBBUUFF 0x02    Used by macro sseettbbuuff
             _FFUUNNGGOOTT 0x04    Used by uunnggeettcc
             _FFEEOOFF   0x08    Tested by macro ffeeooff
             _FFEERRRR   0x10    Tested by macro ffeerrrroorr
             _FFAASSCCIIII 0x20    File is in ASCII mode
             _FFWWRRIITTEE 0x40    File is is opened for writing
             _FFDDOONNTTCC 0x80    Don't close file


_fd is  the file descriptor, which is  used by low-level routines
like  open; it  is  also used  by  reopen.  Finally,  _uc is  the
character  that has  been ``ungotten''  by  uunnggeettcc, should  it be
used.
