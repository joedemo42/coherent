A bit map  is a string of bits in  which each bit has a symbolic,
rather than numeric, value.

***** Notes *****

C permits the manipulation of  bits within a byte through the use
of bit-field routines.   These generate code rather than calls to
routines.  Bit  fields are generally less  efficient than masking
because they always generate masking and shifting.
