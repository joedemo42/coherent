_ _TIME_ _                    Macro                    _ _TIME_ _




Time source file is translated


_ _TIME_ _ is  a preprocessor constant  that is defined  by the C
preprocessor.   It represents  the  time that  a  source file  is
translated.  It is a string literal of the form:


        "hh:mm:ss"


This is the same format used by the function asctime.

The  value   of  this  preprocessor   constant  remains  constant
throughout the processing of the translation unit.  It may not be
the subject of a #define or #undef preprocessing directive.
