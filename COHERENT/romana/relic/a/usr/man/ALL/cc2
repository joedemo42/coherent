cc2                         Definition                        cc2




cc2 is the  optimizer/object generator phase of COHERENT.  It op-
timizes the  code generated by  cc1, and writes  the object code.
COHERENT  uses multiple  optimization algorithms.   One optimizes
jump sequences: it  eliminates common code, optimizes span-depen-
dent jumps, and removes jumps to jumps.  The other function scans
the generated  code repeatedly to  eliminate unnecessary instruc-
tions.
