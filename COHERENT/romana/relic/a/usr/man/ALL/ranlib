ranlib                      Definition                     ranlib




The  ranlib  is a ``directory'' that appears  at the beginning of
each library.  It contains  the name of each global symbol (i.e.,
function name) that appears  within the library, and a pointer to
the module  in which  that symbol  is defined.  Thus,  the ranlib
eliminates the  need for the linker to  search the entire library
sequentially  to find  a  given global  symbol,  which speeds  up
linking noticeably.

If the date on the library  file is later than that in the ranlib
header, the  linker will ignore the ranlib  and perform a sequen-
tial search  through the library;  the linker will  also send the
warning message


        Outdated ranlib


to the  standard error device.   This is done to  prevent the ac-
cidental use  of an outdated  ranlib, which could  be disastrous.
When you use  the archiver ar to update a  library or to create a
new library, be sure to employ the options that update the ranlib
as well as modify or create the library.
