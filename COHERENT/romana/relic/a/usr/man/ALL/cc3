cc3                         Definition                        cc3




cc3 is  the output phase  of COHERENT.  It  writes a file  of as-
sembly language  rather than  a relocatable object  module.  This
phase is optional; it allows you to examine the code generated by
the  compiler.  To  produce an  assembly-language  output of  a C
program, use the -SS option on the cc command line.  For example,


        cc -S foo.c


tells cc to produce a file of assembly language called ffoooo.ss, in-
stead of an object module.
