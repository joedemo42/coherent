putw()                        STDIO                        putw()




Write word into stream

#include <stdio.h>
iinntt ppuuttww(_w_o_r_d, _f_p) iinntt _w_o_r_d; FFIILLEE *_f_p;

The macro ppuuttww writes _w_o_r_d into the file stream pointed to by _f_p.
It returns the value written.

putw differs  from the related macro putc in  that putw writes an
iinntt, whereas ppuuttcc writes a cchhaarr that is promoted to an iinntt.

ferror(), STDIO

***** Diagnostics *****

putw returns EOF when an error occurs.  You may need to call fer-
ror to distinguish this value from a genuine end-of-file flag.

***** Notes *****

Because putw is a macro, arguments with side effects may not work
as expected.   The bytes of word are written  in the natural byte
order of the machine.
