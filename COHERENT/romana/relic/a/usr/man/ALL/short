Data type


short is a numeric data type.  By definition, it cannot be longer
than an int.   Under COHERENT, an int is equal  to an short; that
is, both sizeof int and sizeof short equals two chars, or 15 bits
plus a  sign.  A short normally  is sign extended when  cast to a
larger data  type; however,  an unsigned  short will be  zero ex-
tended when cast.
