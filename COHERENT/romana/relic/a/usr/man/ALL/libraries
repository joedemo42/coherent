libraries                    Overview                   libraries




A library is an archive file of commonly used functions that have
been compiled,  tested, and stored for inclusion  in a program at
link time.

The  COHERENT system  stores  its libraries  in two  directories,
/usr/lib and /lib.  The following libraries are kept in /uussrr/lliibb:


     lliibbccuurrsseess.aa  ccuurrsseess library
     lliibbll.aa       lleexx library
     lliibbmmpp.aa      Multi-precision arithmetic library
     lliibbtteerrmm.aa    tteerrmmccaapp library
     lliibbyy.aa       yyaacccc library
     lliibb.bb        bbcc's function library (in bbcc source)


The following libraries are kept in /lib:


lliibbcc.aa       General functions and system calls
lliibbmm.aa       Mathematics routines
