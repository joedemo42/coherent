void                        C Keyword                        void




Data type


The keyword  void indicates that  the function does  not return a
value.   Using void  declarations makes  programs clearer  and is
useful in error checking.  For example, a function that prints an
error message  and calls  exit to  terminate a program  should be
declared void because it never returns.  A function that performs
a calculation and stores  its result in a global variable (rather
than rreettuurrnning the result),  or one that returns no value, should
also be declared void to  prevent the accidental use of the func-
tion in an expression.
