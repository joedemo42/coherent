The  following table  gives the data  types that  COHERENT recog-
nizes:


          char
          double
          float
          int
          long
          long float
          long int
          short
          short int
          unsigned int
          unsigned long int
          unsigned long
          unsigned char
          unsigned short
          unsigned short int


The terms  lloonngg and lloonngg  iinntt, as are  the terms sshhoorrtt  and sshhoorrtt
iinntt,  ddoouubbllee and  lloonngg  ffllooaatt, uunnssiiggnneedd  sshhoorrtt  iinntt and  uunnssiiggnneedd
sshhoorrtt, and  uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg  iinntt and  uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg.  The  type un-
signed char  was added to the language by  the ANSI Standard; be-
cause COHERENT  uses signed cchhaarrs by default,  you must declare a
cchhaarr to  be uunnssiiggnneedd if  you want it  to be so.  If  this type is
used in  arithmetic expressions, it is  automatically cast to un-
signed int.
