Increase a program's data space

sbrk increases a program's data space by increment bytes.  It in-
crements the variable _ _end; this  variable is set by the C run-
time startup  routine, and   points to  the end of  the program's
data  space.  The  memory  allocation routine  malloc calls  sbrk
should you  attempt to allocate  more space than  is available in
the program's data space.

sbrk returns  a pointer to the previous setting  of _ _end if the
requested memory is available, or NULL if it is not.

***** Notes *****

sbrk will not  increase the size of the program  data area if the
physical memory  requested exceeds the  physical memory allocated
by COHERENT, or if the  requested memory exceeds the limit set in
the user-defined  variable maxmem.  sbrk  does not keep  track of
how space  is used; therefore, memory seized  with sbrk cannot be
freed.  Caveat utilitor.
