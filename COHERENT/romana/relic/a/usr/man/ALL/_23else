#else                Preprocessing Directive                #else




Include code conditionally


The  preprocessing directive  #else  conditionally includes  code
within a  program.  It is preceded by one  of the directives #if,
#ifdef, or  #ifndef, and  may also be  preceded by any  number of
#elif  directives.    If  the  conditional   expressions  of  all
preceding directives evaluate  to false (i.e., to zero), then the
code introduced  by #else is  included within the  program, up to
the #endif directive.

A #if,  #ifdef, or #ifndef directive can be  followed by only one
#else directive.
