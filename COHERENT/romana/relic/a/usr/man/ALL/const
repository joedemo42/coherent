Qualify an identifier as not modifiable


The type  qualifier const marks an  object as being unmodifiable.
An object declared as being const cannot be used on the left side
of an  assignment (an _l_v_a_l_u_e), or have its  value modified in any
way.  Because of  these restrictions, an implementation may place
objects declared to be const into a read-only region of storage.

***** Notes *****

Mark Williams  C recognizes this  keyword, but its  semantics are
not  yet  implemented.  Thus,  storage  declared  with the  const
qualifier will  _n_o_t be treated  as unmodifiable by  the compiler,
and no warnings will be generated.
