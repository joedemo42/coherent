feof()                     STDIO Macro                     feof()




Discover stream status

#include <stdio.h>
iinntt ffeeooff(_f_p) FFIILLEE *_f_p;

feof is a macro that tests  the status of the argument stream fp.
It returns a number other than  zero if fp has reached the end of
file, and zero if it has  not.  One use of feof is to distinguish
a value of -1 returned by getw from an EOF.
