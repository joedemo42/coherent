standard error              Definition             standard error




The  standard  error  is  the  peripheral  device or  file  where
programs write  error messages by default.  It  is defined in the
header file ssttddiioo.hh under the abbreviation ssttddeerrrr, and by default
is the computer's monitor.

The  COHERENT shell  sh lets  you redirect into  a file  all text
written to  the standard error  device.  To do so,  use the shell
operator 2>.  For example


        make 2>errorfile


redirects all  error messages generated by  make into file error-
file.
