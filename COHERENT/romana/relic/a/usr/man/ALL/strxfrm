Transform a string

strxfrm  transforms  string2  using  information  concerning  the
program's locale, as set by the function setlocale.

strxfrm writes  up to n bytes of the  transformed result into the
area pointed to by string1.   It returns the length of the trans-
formed string, not including the terminating null character.  The
transformation   incorporates   locale-specific   material   into
string2.

If n  is set to  zero, strxfrm returns  the length of  the trans-
formed string.

If two  strings return  a given  result when compared  by strcoll
before transformation, they will return the same result when com-
pared by strcmp after transformation.

***** Notes *****

If strxfrm returns  a value equal to or greater  than n, the con-
tents of the area pointed to by string1 are indeterminate.

COHERENT  has  not yet  implemented  the  ANSI locale  functions.
Therefore, strxfrm behaves the same as strcpy.
