Every expression has a _t_y_p_e, such  as int, char, or double.  C is
not strongly typed, which means that it allows different types to
be mixed  relatively freely,  and be  changed (or ccaasstt)  from one
type to another.

COHERENT checks types  more strictly than the C standard implies.
COHERENT's type  checking can be enabled  or disabled in degrees,
using -VVSSTTRRIICCTT and other ``variant'' options with the cccc command.
