NULL                        Definition                       NULL




NULL  is defined  in the  header file stddef.h.   It is  the null
pointer  (cchhaarr  *)00,  which is  a  pointer  initialized to  zero.
Numerous routines  return this value  to indicate failure;  it is
useful  as  a return  value  because it  points  nowhere, and  so
removes the  possibility of accidentally destroying  a section of
memory after failure.
