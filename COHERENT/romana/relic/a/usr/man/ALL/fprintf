fprintf formats  and prints a string.   It resembles the function
printf, except that it  writes its output into the stream pointed
to by fp, instead of to the standard output.

fprintf  uses the  format to  specify an  output format  for arg1
through argN.

See printf for a description of fprintf's formatting codes.

***** Example *****

For an example of this routine, see the entry for fscanf.

printf(), sprintf(), STDIO

***** Notes *****

Because C does not perform type checking, it is essential that an
argument match  its specification.  For example,  if the argument
is a long and the specification  is for an int, fprintf will peel
off the first word of that long and present it as an int.

At present, ffpprriinnttff does not return a meaningful value.
