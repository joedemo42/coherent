stack                       Definition                      stack




The stack is the segment of memory that holds function arguments,
local  variables,  function  return  addresses, and  stack  frame
linkage information.  The COHERENT library sets the stack size to
two kilobytes.  You can change the size of the stack by using the
command fixstack.

If  your program  uses  recursive algorithms,  or declares  large
amounts  of automatic  data, or  simply  contains many  levels of
functions calls,  the stack  may ``overflow'', and  overwrite the
program data.
