standard output             Definition            standard output




The standard  output is the  device or file  where programs write
output  by default.   It is  defined in  the header  file ssttddiioo.hh
under the  abbreviation ssttddoouutt, and in  most instances is defined
to be the computer's monitor.

The  COHERENT shell  sh lets  you redirect into  a file  all text
written to  the standard output device.  To do  so, use the shell
operator >.  For example


        sort myfile >sortfile


redirects the text output by sort into file sortfile.
