Compare two strings, using locale-specific information

#include <string.h>

strcoll  lexicographically  compares  the  string pointed  to  by
string1 with  one pointed to by string2.   Comparison ends when a
null character is read.

strcoll compares the  two strings character by character until it
finds a pair of characters  that are not identical.  It returns a
number less than zero if  the character in string1 is less (i.e.,
occurs earlier  in the character  table) than its  counterpart in
string2.  It returns a  number greater than zero if the character
in string1 is greater (i.e., occurs later in the character table)
than its  counterpart in string2.  If no  characters are found to
differ, then the strings are identical and strcoll returns zero.

***** Notes *****

The string-comparison routines  strcoll, strcmp, and strncmp dif-
fer from  the memory-comparison routine memcmp  in that they com-
pare strings rather than  regions of memory.  They stop when they
encounter a null character, but memcmp does not.

The  ANSI Standard's  description of  strcoll emphasizes  that it
uses  locale-specific information,  as set  by the  ANSI function
setlocale,  to perform string  comparisons.  The  COHERENT system
has not  yet implement ANSI locales;  therefore, strcoll does not
differ  significantly from  strcmp.   It is  included to  support
programs written in ANSI C.
