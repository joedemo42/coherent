_ _DATE_ _                    Macro                    _ _DATE_ _




Date of translation


_ _DATE_ _ is  a preprocessor constant  that is defined  by the C
preprocessor.  It  represents the date  that the source  file was
translated.  It is a string literal of the form


        "Mmm dd yyyy"


where Mmm is the  same three-letter abbreviation for the month as
is used by asctime; dd is  the day of the month, with the first dd
being  a space  if translation  occurs on  the first  through the
ninth day of the month; and yyyy is the current year.

The value  of _ _DATE_ _ remains constant  throughout the proces-
sing of the  a module of source code.  It  may not be the subject
of a #define or #undef preprocessing directive.

***** Example *****

The following prints the preprocessor constants set by COHERENT:

{



        printf("Date: %s\n", __DATE__);
        printf("Time: %s\n", __TIME__);
        printf("File: %s\n", __FILE__);
        printf("Line No.: %d\n", __LINE__);
        printf("ANSI C? %s\n", __STDC__ ? "Yes" : "No");



}
