Return a value and control to calling function


return is a  C statement that returns a value  from a function to
the function that called it.  return can be used without a value,
to return  control of the program to  the calling function; also,
the calling function is free to ignore the value return hands it.
Note that  it is good  programming practice to  declare functions
that return nothing to be of type void.

A function can return only  one value to the function that called
it.  Most  often, this value is used to  signal whether the func-
tion performed successfully or not.
