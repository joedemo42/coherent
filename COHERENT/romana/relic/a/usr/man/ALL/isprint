Check if a character is printable

#iinncclluuddee <ccttyyppee.hh>
iinntt iisspprriinntt(_c) iinntt _c;

isprint is  a macro that tests  if _c is printable,  i.e, if it is
neither a  delete nor a  control character.  It  returns a number
other than zero if _c is  a printable character, and zero if it is
not.  isprint assumes that _c is an ASCII character or EOF.
