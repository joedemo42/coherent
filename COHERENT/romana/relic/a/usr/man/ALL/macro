macro                       Definition                      macro




A macro is a body of text that is given a name.  When the name is
used  in a  program, it  is replaced  with the  text to  which it
refers; this is  called macro expansion.  For example, getchar is
a macro that consists of the function call getc(stdin).

Because macros may employ an argument _n times, any arguments that
have side  effects will have the side effect  repeated _n times as
well, which may be undesirable.
