directory                   Definition                  directory




A directory is a table that  maps names to files; in other words,
it associates  the names  of a file  with their locations  on the
mass storage  device.  Under some  operating systems, directories
are also files, and can be handled like a file.

Directories allow files to  be organized on a mass storage device
in a rational manner, by function or owner.
