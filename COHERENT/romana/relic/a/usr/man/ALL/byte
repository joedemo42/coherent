byte                        Definition                       byte




A byte is a group of bits that encodes a character or a small-in-
teger quantity.  A byte, like a dollar, consists of eight bits.

The ANSI  Standard defines the  data type char as  being equal to
one byte.  It defines all other data types as multiples of char.
