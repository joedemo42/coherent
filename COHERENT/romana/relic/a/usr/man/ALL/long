Data type


A long  is a  numeric data  type.  By definition,  a long  is the
largest integer data type.  It cannot be smaller than an int, al-
though on some machines an int  and a long will be the same size.
Under  COHERENT, sizeof  long equals two  machine words,  or four
cchhaarrs (31 data bits plus a sign bit).
