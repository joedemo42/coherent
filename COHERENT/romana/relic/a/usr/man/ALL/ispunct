ispunct()             ctype Macro (ctype.h)             ispunct()




Check if a character is a punctuation mark

#iinncclluuddee <ccttyyppee.hh>
iinntt iissppuunncctt(_c) iinntt _c;

ispunct tests whether the argument _c is a punctuation mark, i.e.,
neither an  alphanumeric character  nor a control  character.  It
returns a  number other  than zero if  the character tested  is a
punctuation mark, and zero if  it is not.  ispunct assumes that _c
is an ASCII character or EOF.
