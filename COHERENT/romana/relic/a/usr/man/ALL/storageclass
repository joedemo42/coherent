Storage class refers to  the part of a declaration that indicates
how  data  are  to be  stored.   The  C  language recognizes  the
following storage clases:


             auto
             extern
             register
             static


typedef is technically defined as a storage class as well, but it
does  not actually  indicate how  data  are stored.   The default
class is auto.
