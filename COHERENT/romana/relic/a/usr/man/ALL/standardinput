The standard input is the device  or file from which data are ac-
cepted  by default.   It is  defined in  the header  file ssttddiioo.hh
under the abbreviation ssttddiinn, and will be the computer's keyboard
unless redirected by the operating system, a shell, or freopen.

The  COHERENT  shell  sh lets  you  redirect  the standard  input
device.  To do so, use the shell operator <.  For example


        mail fwb <textfile


the standard input device from your terminal to file textfile; in
effect, this commands mails the contents of textfile to use fwb.
