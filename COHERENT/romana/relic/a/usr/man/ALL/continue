continue                    C Keyword                    continue




Force next iteration of a loop


continue forces  the next iteration of a for,  while, or do loop.
For example,


        while ((foo = getchar()) != EOF) {
                if ((foo < 'a') && (foo > 'z'))
                        continue;
                ...             /* do something */
        }


forces the while  loop to throw away everything except lower-case
alphabetic characters.
