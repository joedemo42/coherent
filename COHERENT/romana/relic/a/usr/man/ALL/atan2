atan2()                Mathematics Function               atan2()




Calculate inverse tangent

ddoouubbllee aattaann22(_n_u_m, _d_e_n) ddoouubbllee _n_u_m, _d_e_n;

atan2 calculates  the inverse tangent of the  quotient of its ar-
guments  num/den.  num  and  den may  be any  real numbers.   The
result will be in the range [-P, P].  The sign of the result will
have the same sign as _n_u_m, and the cosine will have the same sign
as _d_e_n.
