C keywords                   Overview                  C keywords




A keyword  is a word that  is reserved within C,  and must not be
used to  name variables,  functions, or macros.   COHERENT recog-
nizes the following C keywords:


         alien           extern          signed
         auto            float           sizeof
         break           for             static
         case            goto            struct
         char            if              switch
         const           int             typedef
         continue        long            union
         default         readonly        unsigned
         do              register        void
         double          return          volatile
         else            short           while
         enum


In conformity  with the  ANSI standard,  the keyword entry  is no
longer  recognized.   The keywords  const  and  volatile are  now
recognized, but not implemented.
