operator                    Definition                   operator




An  operator relates  one operand to  another.  For  example, the
statement


        1+2


relates the  operands 11 and 22 through  the operation of addition;
on the other hand, the statement


        A>B


relates the  operands AA  and BB  logically, by asserting  that the
former is greater than the latter; whereas


        A=B


relates the operands AA and BB by assigning the value of the latter
to the former.  The following is a table of the C operators:


         *       Multiplication
         /       Division
         %       Remainder
         +       Addition
         -       Subtraction



         <       Less than
         <=      Less than or equal to
         >       Greater than
         >=      Greater than or equal to



         &&      Logical AND
         !=      Inequality
         !       Logical negation
         | |     logical OR



         &       Bitwise AND
         ^       Bitwise exclusive OR
         ~       Bitwise complement
         |       Bitwise inclusive OR
         <<      Bitwise shift left
         >>      Bitwise shift right
