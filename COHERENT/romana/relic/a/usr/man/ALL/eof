EOF                         Definition                        EOF




Indicate end of a file

#include <stdio.h>

EOF is  an indicator that is returned  by several STDIO functions
to  indicate that  the current  file position is  the end  of the
file.

Many STDIO functions, when they read EOF, set the end-of-file in-
dicator that  is associated with  the stream being  read.  Before
more data can be  read from the stream, its end-of-file indicator
must be cleared.   Resetting the file-position indicator with the
functions fseek,  fsetpos, or ftell will  clear the indicator, as
will returning  a character to  the stream with  the function un-
getc.
