Define a new data type


typedef  is a  C facility  that lets you  define new  data types.
Such definitions are always made in terms of existing data types;
for example,


        typedef long time_t;


establishes the data type ttiimmee_tt, and defines it to be equivalent
to  a lloonngg.   By  convention, programmer-defined  data types  are
written in capital letters.

Judicious use of the typedef facility can make programs easier to
maintain, and improve their portability.
