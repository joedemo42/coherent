getw()                    STDIO Function                   getw()




Read word from file stream

#include <stdio.h>
iinntt ggeettww(_f_p) FFIILLEE *_f_p;

getw reads a word (an iinntt) from the file stream _f_p.

getw  differs from  getc in  that getw gets  and returns  an iinntt,
whereas getc  returns either a  cchhaarr promoted to an  iinntt, or EOF.
To detect EOF while using ggeettww, you must use feof.

canon, getc(), STDIO

***** Notes *****

getw returns EOF on errors.

getw assumes  that the bytes of  the word it receives  are in the
natural byte ordering of the machine.  This means that such files
might not be portable between machines.
