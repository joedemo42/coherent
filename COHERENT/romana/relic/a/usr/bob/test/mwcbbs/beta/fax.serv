Mr. Duskey:

We are interested in providing our customers with the types of
services that FAXFACTS appears to provide. Unfortunately, the
FAXFACTS document #8806 regarding pricing is a bit vague regarding
what would be required to outfit an existing PC/AT compatible
computer.

Could you provide more specific information for us from the
point of view of outfitting a company with the necessary
software/hardware which already has a PC/AT compatible computer?

Do you also deal with other systems that can provide support
similar to FAXFACTS?

Thank you,





Bob Hemedinger
