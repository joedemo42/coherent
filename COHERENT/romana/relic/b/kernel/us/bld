# Revision 1.1  92/07/17  15:29:51  bin
# Initial revision
# 
# Revision 1.3  92/01/10  10:09:12  hal
# Add "dbg" option.
# Default to rootdev = pipedev = (0,0).
# 
#

# Shell variables
#	DRIVERS is the list of device drivers to be linked into the kernel.
#	COH_TYPE is one of [ fl | at | ss | aha ] and is for information -
#		it is the suffix on the name of the kernel produced.
#	BOOTDEV is the device name for the COHERENT boot floppy or partition -
#		it is passed to the "config" script.
#	HD is the device driver name for the hard drive device driver linked
#		into this kernel - it is one of [ aha154x | at | ss ], or
#		may be omitted entirely for a floppy-only system.
#	KB is one of [ kb | nkb ] - the first of these uses fixed keyboard
#		tables and scan code set 1, and source is provided in the
#		driver kit;  use it if you are concerned about supporting
#		keyboards of questionable compatibility or want to work with
#		keyboard driver source - the second of these uses loadable
#		keyboard tables for international support, but requires
#		full compatibility, and source code is not provided in the
#		driver kit.
#	DEBUG is empty for normal kernels, is "dbg" if debug versions of
#		kernel and drivers are wanted

# Default arguments -
#   use old kb driver, at hard disk, let tboot set rootdev & pipedev
