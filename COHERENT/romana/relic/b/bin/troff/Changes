troff source change log begun 5/24/92

Sun May 17 09:40:24 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.24.
getf.c
		Added test for bogus names for special characters, etc.
		after fwb typed font escape as part of special character name.

Mon May 25 11:23:42 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.25.
req2.c
		Removed debugging printf() left in by accident, oops...

Wed May 27 23:39:24 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.26.
fonts.c
fonts.h
fwtable.c
fwtable.h
fwt_TFM.c
fwt_PS.c
		Changed int to short in font width table processor and
		reader, so that compilation under COH386 produces bits
		which work as expected with the font width tables.

Thu May 28 15:53:49 1992 PDT
main.c
		Print detailed usage message on illegal arg error
		or if new option -? is specified.

Wed Jun  3 23:35:29 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.26.
		Changed ABFSIZE from 128 to 256, after user complained
		that it was too small.
request.c
		Corrected bug in array bound check which caused troff
		to core dump on arg string of precisely ABFSIZE characters.

Thu Aug  6 08:35:23 1992 PDT
main.c
		V3.2.27: fixed temp file name code which wrote on
		quoted string template, which causes core dump under COH4.0.

Tue Jan 26 16:20:51 1993 PST
roff.h
		V4.0.1.
fwtable.h
		Deleted unused bogus definition "extern long fseek();",
		defined correctly (as int fseek()) in new <stdio.h>.
req1.c
		Changed req_cu() to just do a .ul.
		This is somewhat wrong,
		.cu is supposed to underline spaces as well as words,
		but it is much better than the way it worked before.
req2.c
		Changed req_ul() to handle ".ul 0" correctly.

Wed Feb  3 17:44:05 1993 PST
process.c
		V4.0.2: changed local horizontal motion default unit
		from 'u' to 'm'.  User Andrew Houghton reported that "\h'-1'"
		did not backspace; he expected the implicit unit to
		be ems, as in Unix.

Thu Feb  4 09:54:32 1993 PST
main.c
		V4.0.3: fixed tempfile code to call mktemp() like it used to.

Mon Mar  1 08:48:19 1993 PST
main.c
		V4.0.4: in main(), fixed arg processing to ignore tempfile
		arg after "-f".

Fri Mar  5 15:24:13 1993 PST
process.c
		V4.0.5: Deleted unnecessary "#include <ascii.h>".
req2.c
		Changed "#include <ascii.h>" to "#include <sys/ascii.h>".
		In req_tl(), set font to "R".  Previously, .tl at the
		start of a file caused troff to core dump.

Tue Mar 30 14:45:56 1993 PST
fwtable.h
fwt_TFM.c
		fwtable V1.4: changed "getint();" to "getword();" and
		int -> short in several places for COH386.  Added verbose
		usage() message.  Deleted debugging output.

Wed Mar 31 12:14:41 1993 PST
fwt_TFM.c
		fwtable V1.5: corrected bug in writing slant value word
		which led to incorrect escape sequence for italic fonts.

Wed Apr  7 17:49:09 1993 PDT
main.c
		V4.0.6: at fwb's request, modified leave() to print page
		eject even for nonzero exit status; previously, it ejected
		the current page on success, but not on fatal errors.

Fri Apr 23 14:18:10 1993 PDT
main.c
		V4.0.7: changed exit status for usage() from 1 to 2,
		allowing leave() to avoid core dumping as it exits.

Thu Sep  2 17:32:13 1993 CDT
roff.h
main.c
req2.c
		V4.0.8: minor hacks to allow compilation under current headers.
