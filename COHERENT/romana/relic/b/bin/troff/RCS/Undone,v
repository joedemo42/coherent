fwtable:
	Understand TFMs
	Write version ID in fwt
	Change width fields from unsigned to signed
[nt]roff:
	Line thickness
	Should \h generate a wordbreak?  Seems not to now...
troff:
	PS outline fonts?
	Modify fwts as per fwtable

Command line option for full vs. partial character set?
Output character set fix:
	Currently kludged, cf. esc.h.
	The escape characters should be 256, 257, ...
	Buffers and pointers where getf() characters are stored must become
		arrays of int, not char.
Unimplemented requests: cf. request.h and req[01].c/TO_DO.
Unimplemented escapes: cf. esc.h and process.c/TO_DO
Unimplemented registers: cf. getf.c
