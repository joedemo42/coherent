Changes to yacc source

Tue Jan 23 12:31:31 1990 PST
makefile
	Added -n flag for i8086.
yacc.h
	Changed #include <mdata.h> -> <sys/mdata.h>.
y2.c
	Changed line 455:
		fprintf(tabout, "struct yytname yytnames[%d] =\n{\n", nterm);
	to
		fprintf(tabout, "struct yytname yytnames[%d] =\n{\n", nterm+1);
	The code writes a NULL-terminated array with nterm members
	plus a NULL terminator.  The most recent version of the compiler
	complained (e.g. when compiling the yacc'ed grammar for bc) because the
	array declaration included too many initializers.
