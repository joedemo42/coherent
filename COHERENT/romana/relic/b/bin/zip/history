Thank you for your comments.  Here is Zip 0.3 with almost all of that fixed.
The changes include:

1. Put \n\ for newlines in long strings (everyone had this problem).
2. Wrote my own bsearch (called search---different args).
3. Wrote my own timelocal (called invlocal), used whether STDC or not.
   (Note to Greg: look at the code---I found a simple way to do it.)
4. -m now deletes empty directories also.
5. Changed crc.c to util.c and put search() in util.c.
6. Changed "void *" to "voidp *" and made voidp void for STDC, else char.
7. Removed -a option.
8. Some minor changes to zip.doc.

I did not do anything about Cliff Manis's problem with DIR not being
defined.  DIR should have been defined in sys/dir.h.  If it wasn't, then
there's something wrong with dir.h, or it is missing, or the opendir, etc.
functions are missing.  I don't really want to think about what to do for
the latter possibility.

NUnzip 3.99 does not appear to be Unix-ready.  It fails for file names longer
than 12 characters (Segmentation fault), cannot find explicit names that
do not contain a dot, and does not notice the Unix identifier (which should
switch off name to lower-case mapping).

------------------------ Nov 20  1990   version 0.4 ------------------------
Yo Zippers,

Here is a first attempt at a Zip intended to work on System V.  Try using
"make sysv" for such systems.  I also included replacements for memset()
and memcmp() by Bill Davidsen and James Dugal for systems without those.
Use "make old" to include those routines.  Sun's use getdents() like Sys V,
even though it's BSD, so use "make sun".  For others, try just "make".

When using "make" a second time with a different request, it's best to erase
all the .o files to force recompiling everything.

What follows are the changes I made and some things to try if you get it
compiled.  Have fun.

Mark


Changes from Zip 0.3 to Zip 0.4:

1.  Changed third arg of search() to size_t to make lint happier.
2.  Replaced zip.doc with a man page, zip.1 (raw) and zip.man (formatted).
3.  rename() replaced with link() and unlink().
4.  Fixed vem in central header and added REVISION and REVDATE #define's
    to zip.h.  (Didn't read Phil's appnote.txt carefully enough there.)
5.  Removed prototypes except for development host (NeXT).  (They're only
    there for my benefit anyway---they should not affect the resulting
    code.  Consider them some meager documentation.)
6.  Changed rindex() to strrchr().
7.  Improved behavior on a write failure when -b is used.
8.  Added Bill Davidsen's and James Dugal's memset(), memcpy(), and
    memcmp() routines under the trusty ZMEM #define.
9.  Check that zip file is writeable before doing any real work.
10. Added #ifdef REGEX to use regcmp(), regex() instead of re_comp(),
    re_exec().  (We'll see if this works.)
11. Replaced opendir(), readdir(), closedir() with my own opend(), readd(),
    and closed() routines that use getdirentries() on BSD and getdents() on
    System V (I hope) and Sun's.  An #ifdef DIRENT selects getdents().
12. zip.h no longer #includes string.h, instead defining the string
    functions used explicitly.


If you get Zip 0.4 to compile, here are some things to test:

1.  Try zipping up some stuff, of course.  Use all the options that are
    implemented.  Especially try -rp and -rpm on a directory tree (use
    *test* files and directories, of course).
2.  Naturally check with unzip -t, but also check with "zip xxx" where
    xxx.zip is the zip file.  This should say "nothing to do", but if it
    says "error in zip file structure", there's a problem.
3.  After zipping, check that there are no $Z* files leftover.
4.  Try using -b, specifying a path on another device.  Check for $Z*'s.
5.  Try -d and a regular expression (like \*.o) on a zip file.
6.  And I'm interested in timing---try it on a 500K or so text file.

------------------------ Nov 27  1990   version 0.5 ------------------------
Hail fellow zippers,

Here's Zip 0.5.  The biggie is it now includes implosion, courtesy of Rich
Wales.  Even as we speak, he is working on new algorithms for implode that
promise to be significantly faster.  He might even get a paper out of it ...

You can use the -s option (shrink only) when testing to save a little time,
but also try it normally to test implosion (if you test with text files
of reasonable length, implosion will be chosen for most of them).  Also, for
speed testing of implosion, use -i to not waste time trying to shrink.

Including implosion about doubles the size of zipnn.tar.Z, so I would like
some input on distributing subsequent versions.  Would y'all like to keep
on getting the uuencoded version via mail, or would you prefer a notice
about availability via anonymous ftp on simtel20.army.mil in <w8sdz.zip>?
(I have been sending the previous versions to Keith to put there, and will
continue to do so.  I do not know what the lag time is for him to move it
there.)

The other important change is that this is another attempt at getting the
directory access routines working on all systems.  Read the installation
part of the manual page (zip.man).  And if you feel like, read the whole
thing.  I'm also taking suggestions for and bugs in the documentation.

The differences from Zip 0.4 include:

1. Changed all occurences of "size_t" to "extent" and typedef'ed extent
   to size_t (after an #include <stddef.h>) for ANSI C, or unsigned int
   otherwise.  If anyone finds that they have a non ANSI C, that size_t
   is defined, and that it is not the size of the compiler's int, then
   please let me know.
2. Changed help() to put the help text in a static array of strings and
   then printf() for each line.  Some compilers barfed on the long
   string.  Suggested by davidsen@crdos1.crd.ge.com.
3. Added Rich Wales' implode routines, made their inclusion the default
   (changed #ifdef IMPLODE to #ifndef NOIMPLODE).
4. Put "extern int errno;" in unixfile.c (redundant extern's should be ok).
5. Minor changes to the man page (zip.1 and zip.man).
6. Added warnings for names given on the command line that are not matched.
   Lack pointed out by grimesg@sj.ATE.SLB.COM (George).
7. Changed back to opendir(), etc. on BSD systems.
8. Added NDIR #define for HPUX to #include <ndir.h> instead of <sys/dir.h>.
9. Redid Makefile, adding next (use shared library), sysvpw (System V's
   that require linking the libPW library for regex routines), and hpux
   (see #8 above).

As usual, report problems to info-zip@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil.  If you wish,
you can, in addition, send the same report to me (madler@piglet.caltech.edu)
or Rich (wales@cs.ucla.edu) if the problem is with implosion (i* files) for
quicker reponse.

your humble servant,
Mark Adler
------------------------ Dec  7  1990   version 0.6 ------------------------
Greetings and Felicitations Honorable Zip Compatriots,

I have uploaded Zip 0.6, which incorporates most of your helpful comments,
to Simtel20.Army.Mil, and it should evenually end up in <W8SDZ.ZIP> as
ZIP06.TAR-Z.  The most significant change is the addition of encryption
both as the -e option in Zip, and a new program, ZipCloak, that encrypts
and decrypts zip entries.  This surely adds some new portability problems,
due to the getp() routine which reads a password from the terminal with no
echoing.  We'll see how well this flies ...

If someone wants to PKZIP up the tar.Z file, please do so.  I didn't zip
it up myself because a) I'm lazy, and b) PKZIP can compress it better
anyhow, and I don't have a PC.

Also, there is an EXPORT symbol used to remove encryption, so I can make
an export version that does not have -e or ZipCloak.  This version will
simply be missing a few source files and have a different Makefile.

I also added a few systems to the Makefile, and made some other changes to
it based on all your detailed comments.  If it still works after all that,
I'll be amazed.

Those and other changes from 0.5 to 0.6 are detailed at the end of this note.

I have not addressed the portability problem with the implode routines,
since that is Rich's domain.  I have no idea what is causing it.  (For those
who don't know, one system produced remarkable 90% compression rates with
implode, but alas, it is a bug.)

One fellow complained that zipping up the README file results in a zip file
that is larger than the original, even though Zip claims it compressed it.
Well, it did compress it, but the ZIP file format has an overhead of
76+2*N bytes per file+22 bytes, where N is the length of the file name.
And that's without comments or "extra" information.  So, a zip file with a
single file whose name has six characters has an overhead of 110 bytes.
README gets shrunk by 16% from 274 bytes to 230 bytes, resulting in a total
zip file size of 340 bytes---larger than the original file (274 bytes).
The moral is don't expect zip to compress a single small file.  The other
moral is use unzip -v to see the compression.

Someone else asked about multi-disk zip files.  I'm not sure I believe in
those, since PKZIP and PKUNZIP do not appear to suppport them (though it is
part of the ZIP file definition in APPNOTE.TXT).  What I was planning on
doing for that case was to write a ZipSplit program that would take a large
zip file and try to optimally split it into the fewest number of zip files
that are all less than the specified size.  Each would be a complete, stand
alone zip file---not part of a single, multi-disk zip file.  There would
also be a ZipMerge program.

This is the version of Zip that will live in infamy (note the revision date).
Of course, some current Presidents of the United States think that should be
September 7th, but I won't name any names.

I am going on vacation for about two weeks, so I expect to find many new
problems reported upon my return.

And lastly, for my Holiday Greetings: Party On Dudes.

Here are the changes from Zip 0.5 to Zip 0.6:

1.  Minor documentation changes (zip.1 and zip.man).
2.  Fixed an embarrasing lack of recursion in opend/readd/closed functions
    that only existed in 0.5.
3.  Moved $(LDFLAGS) to end of the linking command line in Makefile.
4.  Added make dnix for DNIX 5.2, 5.3 not using optimization (no -O).
5.  Wrote ZipCloak for encryption and decryption.
6.  Rich changed the output routines of implode to use zfwrite and zputc to
    provide hooks for encryption (defined in crypt.h).  Also removed
    function prototypes unless PROTO defined.
7.  Added encryption (-e) to Zip.
8.  Added make pyramid (use rindex() instead of strrchr()).
9.  Changed make to $(MAKE) and cc to $(CC) in Makefile.
10. Took out strip in Makefile.
11. Changed year from 1991 to 1990.  (How'd *that* get in there?  Of course,
    it's not as bad as when I wrote a check the other day and dated it 1977.
    I think my brain cell isn't working as well as it used to.)
12. Added make cray (use scc instead of cc).
13. Added make amdahl (use system() instead of rmdir()).
14. Added entry of one-line comments for added files (-c).
15. Put comment delimiters around name following #endif's in Rich's code.

------------------------ Feb 13  1991   version 0.7 ------------------------
Fellow stuck zippers,

Well folks, it's been a while since 0.6. so there have been a lot of
changes on the way to 0.7.  The exhaustive listing is below, but here are
some highlights ...

Implode now (appears) to be PKUNZIP compatible.  There were many odd
little requirements implosed by the coding of PKUNZIP that were obtained
from Phil Katz and associates.  Now that Rich has that working, he will
likely be working on much faster string matching routines to speed up
implode.

User interrupts (control-C or kill) are now caught and the temporary files
are deleted, making for a clean getaway.

Self-extracting zip files for MSDOS can now be processed, with the
extensions zip, ZIP, exe, or EXE.  This allows you to make self-extracting
zip files for MSDOS by taking an existing one (like PKZ110.EXE) and
deleting all the entries to get a prototype self-extracting zip file that
can be copied and added to.  Of course, you should only do this if you are
a registered user of PKZIP.  Note that if the file does not end in .zip,
you have to give the full name.

I have relaxed some of the restrictions on zip files to allow processing
ones with "authenticity verification" (applied by the PUTAV program that
comes with PKZIP).  Of course, the authenticity no longer checks out if
you muck with the file, but at least you can muck with it now.

The Makefile has been considerably simplified, thanks to suggestions from
Jean-Loup Gailly.  Also, I wrote my own sh expression matcher, eliminating
the regular expression hassles, and the REGEX symbol and -lPW options in
the Makefile.

Many, many cosmetic changes, the most dangerous of which was turning on
prototypes again in the hopes we can get them to work.  If they cause you
problems, record the problems (for me), and then add a -DNOPROTO to the
appropriate line in the Makefile and try again.

This version now compiles under Microsoft C 5.1 and Turbo C++ 1.0, with
much thanks to Jean-Loup Gailly.  I say "compiles" and not "works" because
I have not thoroughly tested it.  It does work, but there may be errors in
the port as well as errors in the design.  By the latter I mean that there
may be some disagreement over what you expect it to do and what it does,
especially with regards to upper and lower case names and wildcard
patterns.  Also, the implode routines do not yet work under MSDOS, so the
compilations are done using NOIMPLODE.  There are two dumb batch files to
do the compile: doturboc.bat and domsc.bat.  If someone would like to
write make files for the make utilities that come with those languages,
please be my guest.  I'm just too lazy.  However, I would probably resist
including make files that require a make utility that does not come with
those languages, be it commercial, shareware, or free.

There are two new programs: ZipSplit and Ship.  ZipSplit tries to split a
big zip file into the smallest number of zip files less than a specified
size.  This is to aid in using zip to backup to floppies.  It has the
limitation that it cannot break up an entry in a zip file, since it makes
complete, standalone zip files.  This means if any entry is larger than
the specified size (plus some overhead), zipsplit will give up and not do
the split.  It does *not* implement the multi-disk zip file format implied
in APPNOTE.TXT.  ZipSplit will optionally write an index file and deduct
the size of that file from the first zip file so both will fit on the
first disk.

Ship is a fixed-up version of a program I have been using myself for some
time in place of uuencode/uudecode.  It's purpose is to facilitate sending
zip files through the mail.  It uses a more efficient coding scheme than
uuencode (four bytes per five characters instead of three bytes per four
characters) and includes a crc at the end of each file to check the
veracity what was received.  It can split its output to a specified size
and recombine it automatically at the other end, verifying the sequence.
It can also mail the parts to a specified address, with subject lines
identifying the parts, instead of making a bunch of files that you're just
going to mail and delete anyway.  Example:

     % ship -500 -m saddam@pickle.iq README zip07.zip
     README shipped
     zip07.zip shipped
     files part0001..part0004 mailed

will mail README and zip07.zip together in four chunks of 500 or fewer
lines each.  At the other end, Saddam can save the parts into the files
named in the subject lines (part0001..part0004), and then do:

     % ship -u part*
     README received
     zip07.zip received

For now, zip.1 (and zip.doc) are incomplete as far as MSDOS goes.  I'll
put off doing that until the MSDOS version has stabilized.  Likewise, I
have put off writing zipcloak.1, zipsplit.1, and ship.1 for the same
reason.

There are, of course, all the little changes that fix bugs (what are
those?), make the Makefile work on more systems, documentation, and,
for the alert reader, an undocumented option ...

As usual, send reports to info-zip@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil, so everyone
can get a chuckle out of whatever new bugs I've introduced.

Changes from release 0.6 to release 0.7:

1.  Changed Makefile to use mv instead of -o on compiles.
2.  Added MAKE = make to Makefile.
3.  Catch user interrupt or termination and delete temporary files.
4.  Allow general purpose flags in local and central headers to differ in
    the "reserved" bits.  Keep both for copying zip entries verbatim.
5.  Removed prototype for closedir--return value not used and inconsistent
    across systems.
6.  Wrote ZipSplit to break a large zip file into the smallest number of
    zip files less than a specified size.  Run zipsplit with no arguments
    to see the command help.
7.  Put error messages in globals.c to be common across zip, zipcloak, and
    zipsplit.  Use #define's in zip.h for error numbers.
8.  Changed getp() to open a new file for the terminal device, and added
    the echon() function to turn echoing back on when interrupted at
    password prompt.
9.  Added warn()'s to distinguish various zip file structure errors.
10. Allow "extra" fields in local and central headers to differ.
11. Fixed percent compression calculation to work for very large files.
12. Included the program (makecrc.c) that generates the CRC table.
    makecrc.c is not compiled or run by the Makefile, but is present for
    completeness.
13. Added an undocumented (except for here) option, -v, to zip that checks
    for "oddities" in the zip file structure and points them out if found
    (but continues processing).
14. Put prototypes in crypt.h inside #ifdef NeXT to avoid redefinition
    problems with other compilers.
15. Added "make zilog" for Zilog S8000 running Zeus 3.21.
16. Minor changes to the manual page (zip.1 and zip.doc).
17. Fixed bug in replace() (manifested by -b option).
18. readzipfile() now also checks the central directory start and size in
    the end of central directory header.
19. Allow modification of self-extracting zip files (exe instead of zip).
20. Allow .ZIP as valid suffix as well as .zip (also .EXE and .exe).
21. Cleaned up malloc usage, free'd everything malloc'ed.
22. fclose'd all fopen'ed files explicitly.
23. Corrected assignment of one ftell() result from an int to a long.
24. Considerably simplified Makefile, based on Jean-Loup Gailly's
    suggestions.
25. Renamed unixfile.c to fileio.c in anticipation of non-unix support.
26. Removed const's (pesky little buggers caused too many problems).
27. Wrote my own shell expression compare routine, took REGEX and -lPW's
    out of Makefile, which removed the sysvpw make option.
28. Added tempname() prototype to crypt.h for the implode routines to use.
29. Trying string.h for prototypes of string functions if __STDC__
    defined, which is what unzip.h does.
30. Turned prototypes on if __STDC__ defined (we'll try this one more
    time).  They can be turned off using NOPROTO.
31. Improved source documentation.
32. Changed prototype of open in fileio.c to OF((char *, int, ...)).
33. Removed "local" from prototypes of main() (after all, it's *not*
    local).
34. Wrote Ship program to supplant uuencode--slightly more efficient, has
    error checking, file splitting, automatic mailing, other features.
    Ship currently uses the command:
        /usr/ucb/mail -s subject < tempfile
    to send mail.  Please let me know what works for your system.  Note
    that I want to be able to specify a subject line.
35. Ported to MSDOS Microsoft C 5.1, based on Jean-Loup Gailly's work.
36. Fixed add/update bug when -p not used.
37. Handle lower case conversion and devices (e.g. C:) for MSDOS.
38. Indented the #ifdef/#ifndef constructs that do not contain function
    definitions, to improve the readability somewhat.
39. Cleaned up error handling.  Now use perror() for i/o errors.  Put the
    errors and messages in ziperr.h.
40. Ported to MSDOS Turbo C++ 1.0.
41. Implemented wild card expansion on the command line for MSDOS and
    handle MSDOS matching (*.* == all, not *).
42. Changed version required to unzip to 11 (1.10) since the implode
    routines can procude an overlapping match one away from the end of the
    window (PKUNZIP 1.00 requires two away from the end).
43. Changed old next make option to next10 (for version 1.0) and added a
    new next make option for 2.0 (just called next) that uses the -object
    linking option for smaller executables.
44. Added -z option to take a multi-line zip file comment from stdin.
45. Changed temporary names from $ZXXXXXX to _ZXXXXXX, where XXXXXX is
    filled in by mktemp().  This avoids problems with "rm $Z*" in sh.
46. Got new implode routines from Rich that are (hopefully) PKUNZIP
    compatible.
47. When -b is not specified, put the temporary files in the same
    directory (i.e. the same device) that the zip file is (or will be) in.
48. Added doturboc.bat and domsc.bat files to compile for Turbo C++ 1.0
    and Microsoft C 5.1.  I am interested in successes and failures with
    other versions of those compilers.  In this version, the implode
    routines do not work under MSDOS.
------------------------ May  6  1991   version 0.8 ------------------------
Buenos Dias Amigos,

Heer ees dee Cinco de Mayo reeleese of seep, aka Zip 0.8.  The changes
from 0.7 are in the (long) list below, but here are some highlights:
faster implode, faster shrink, first attempt at a VMS version (thanks
to Cave Newt), and a new program, ZipNote, to aid in editing zip file
comments.  To compile under VMS, do an "@makevms.com".  To compile using
Mircosoft C do a "make makefile.msc".  To compile using Borland (Turbo)
C, do a "make -fmakefile.bor".  Please try to break any or all of these
programs in every conceivable way--we're getting close a public release.
Thank yew fer your support.

Mark Adler
madler@pooh.caltech.edu

Changes from 0.7 to 0.8:

1.  Added the -n option to prevent compressing already compressed files.
    Documented -n in zip.1.
2.  Check the length of the compressed data in zipup() in case implode or
    shrink has a bug.
3.  Fixed -v option to not complain about needing PKUNZIP 1.1.
4.  Added report of store/shrink/implode sizes when -v (verbose) used.
5.  Put in Rich's patch to fix 100% implosion bug.
6.  Fixed -i bug.
7.  Made changes to im_ctree.c and implode.c to (hopefully) make it work
    under MSDOS.  (Jean-Loup said declare topmaxvals and botmaxvals as
    U_INT in im_ctree.c, and use MSDOS, not __MSDOS__ in implode.c.)
8   Added implode routine compilation to domsc.bat and doturboc.bat.
9.  Replaced FILENAME_MAX with FNMAX, which is now always 1024.  (It seems
    FILENAME_MAX is incorrectly set to 14 on some System V Unixii.)
10. Changed BEST to -1 so it is different from STORE (=0).  Redid some of
    the method logic in zipup().
11. Changed wb+ to w+b in implode.c.
12. Removed "nothing to do" error for -u and -f.
13. Zip source distributions will now have tabs removed, except for
    Makefile and Makefile.exp (no feelthy tabs rule).
14. Changed zip error on open failure to a warning.  This accounts for
    files that do not have read permission or are locked, and files
    deleted during the zip.  For entries being updated, the old entry is
    copied over instead.  This change had the side effect of removing the
    zipskip() routine.
15. Removed OBJC dependencies in Makefile.exp (didn't belong).
16. Removed strip from Makefile, instead using the -s link option.
17. Fixed -um and -fm to delete files whose entry's times were checked in
    the archive.
18. Put portability stuff common to zip.h and crypt.h into tailor.h.
19. Added mark tracing to -v (for debugging).
20. Changed name and zname logic--an external name is always converted
    into an internal zname, and vice-versa.  zname is now always
    malloc'ed.
21. Fixed -z to use CRLF between lines (for PKZIP) and have no newline
    after the last (or only) line.
22. Added clean to Makefile (deletes *.o, zip, zipcloak, zipsplit, ship).
23. Replaced LDFLAGS with LFLAGS1 and LFLAGS2 in Makefile (splits link
    options before and after object files as in unzip).
24. Added scodos to Makefile (from Bill Davidsen).
25. Included stdio.h in tailor.h--removed stdio.h from zip.h and
    implode.h.
26. Do not include stddef.h if M_XENIX defined.
27. Cast the arguments of all free() calls to (voidp *).
28. Added casts to char * for memset() and qsort() args in zipsplit.c.
29. Changed implode.h to define malloc and str* properly.
30. Fixed invlocal() to handle integer overflow correctly, as well as
    reliably across compilers.
31. Got new implode.h from Rich with fix #29 above.  Removed stdio.h
    include.
32. Commented out the abort() calls in im_ctree.c.
33. -ee requests a verification of the encryption password.
34. malloc and free tempath.
35. Documented -, SCO, and scodos in zip.1, and - in help().
36. Added revision.h for Zip revision number and date.
37. -u and -f with no arguments now (both) freshen the entire archive.
38. Use /Oait instead of /Ox for MSC to avoid loop optimization (buggy on
    5.1, and sometimes even crashes compiler!).
39. Added ! (reverse) range matching to shmatch(), and early abort on '*'
    failures (speeds up pathological patterns).  Cleaned up '\' (escape)
    handling.
40. Changed '!' in ship to '{' (some EBCDIC translations do not include
    !).  However, unship (ship -u) still understands '!'.  Also added the
    -v option of ship to print out the version and revision date.  Also
    now refuse to overwrite an existing file when unshipping (ship -u),
    but there is a -o option to overwrite anyway.
41. Added a "fast" mode to ship using hard-arithmetic coding that is
    nearly as efficient as base 85 coding, but much faster on 16-bit
    machines (base 85 coding uses 32 bit multiplication and division).
42. Put tailor.h back in ship.c, so that ship.c can stand on its own.
43. Made -p the default, and added a new option, -j to do the opposite
    (junk directory names).  -p is still there but does nothing, so as to
    avoid annoying PKZIP users.  Changed documentation and help()
    accordingly.
44. If -j is used, and two files are to be added with the same name, then
    zip exits with an error.
45. Wrote ZipNote for editing zipfile comments.  Just do zipnote for
    usage.
46. Replaced Rich's im_lmat.c with a new one from Jean-Loup.  Improves the
    speed of implode by a factor of two, and even more for very large
    files.
47. Reduced the execution time of shrink by 33% simply by moving the code
    around (eliminated some unnecessary calls, moved some tests).
    Shrink's execution time is now about 50% more than compress (it used
    to take over twice as long).  Hash tables for shrink are still
    intended for a future release.
48. VMS mods from Greg: replace() unlinks only after copy, changed
    delete() to destroy(), added code for deletedir(), use creation time
    instead of modification time, warn if stamp() attempted, changed
    includes, make link rename and unlink delete, added findfirst,
    findnext stuff, added wild() for VMS, modified newname(), procname().
49. Implemented internal<-->external name conversions for MSDOS and VMS.
50. For VMS matching, changed ? to %, removed bracketed ranges.
51. Added makevms.com, stolen from Unzip (vms_make.com).
52. Implemented -k (force the zip file to look like it was made by PKZIP).
53. Removed implode for VMS (it crashes--haven't tracked down where).
54. Got Jean-Loup's makefile.dos working for MSC 5.1 (makefile.msc) and
    Turbo C++ 1.0 (makefile.bor).
------------------------ Jul 11  1991   version 0.9 ------------------------
Hey gang,

Here is our very-nearly-ready-to-release version of Zip.  There will be no
features added or changed from 0.9 to 1.0--only bugs fixed.  I hope that
we can get 1.0 out pretty quickly then.  This is really your last chance to
find bugs before it goes out, so please, please test all the programs as
much as you can.  Try all the features, if possible, and perhaps try to
think of ways to break the programs.  Also, and this is very important, read
the documentation in zip.doc and "debug" that too.  I already know that it
is not complete in 0.9, but please send any comments about errors, omissions,
format, or whatever to Info-ZIP, even if they seem obvious.

The highlights of the changes from 0.8 to 0.9 are: faster, slicker implode;
operation in small model on MSDOS for speed; a new temporary file interface
for faster operation on small files; some shrink improvements; and some new
options (-y, -g, -q).  Also, ship has been enhanced in several ways, not the
least of which is a help option (-h).

Have fun.

Changes from 0.8 to 0.9:

1.  Removed the "not implemented yet" note in help() for -k (it *is*
    implemented now).  Removed from bug list in zip.1 too.
2.  Fixed Turbo C implode bug.
3.  Added /link /e in makefile.msc for ship.c.
4.  Made handler() in zipnote.c the same as handler() in zipsplit.c.
5.  Added -y option in Unix to store symbolic links as such.  (We need
    Unzip to be aware of symbolic links and use symlink() to recreate them.)
6.  Ignore control characters in unship input.
7.  Use prototypes and ANSI libraries if MSDOS.  (Used to check for Turbo C,
    but Microsoft C 6.0 also does not define __STDC__ unless strict ANSI
    is requested.)
8.  Added mod to ct_fsort() from Rich that should remove any qsort()
    dependencies in implode output.
9.  Removed some 32/16-bit prejudices in util.c and crypt.c that affect
    64-bit integer (short, int, and long) machines (Cray).
10. Added System V MAILX option to ship.c to use the mailx command.  This
    is automatically activated by DIRENT if ship is compiled by the zip
    makefile.
11. Added patches from Greg Roelofs for echo control on Cray and Amdahl.
    The patch uses termio.h and ioctl(), and is assumed for all System V,
    not just those (we'll see how this flies).
12. Changed -Ox to -Oacegit -FPi87 in makefile.msc.  Added /nologo to link.
13. Applied J-L's 082 mods (Sinatra style): select 4K window for < 5.5K,
    8K window for >= 5.5K files (just like PK does); various im_ctree.c
    mods verbatim (except for the treename warning, which I did differently);
    various im_lmat.c mods verbatim (except macros are done the ugly portable
    way); farmalloc'ed in shrink.c; changed makefile.msc and makefile.bor to
    use small model; added J-L to zip.1 acknowledgements (oops).
14. Moved struct zlist's and struct flist's to far storage (needed by above
    mods).  Unfortunately, I can't move the names and other things pointed to
    by those structures into the far space, since they are arguments to
    library functions like strcmp() and fwrite().
15. Changed zipup() to both shrink and implode only on files smaller than
    BSZ.  Also in that case, free up shrink data structures before allocating
    the implode data structures.  Changed from fopen() to open() except for
    VMS.
16. Fixed bug in dosmatch() to free malloc'ed space.
17. MINIX mods (do not need minix make option): call tempname() with a unique
    character (MINIX mktemp() flawed); defined S_IWRITE as S_IWUSR if S_IWUSR
    defined; removed explicit signal dereference.
18. Fixed bug in unship when used as a filter with no args.
19. Changed getnam() to not use static storage.
20. Copy permissions from old to new zip file (zip, zipcloak, zipnote).
21. Added patches for AT&T 3B1, added 3b1 target to makefile, added to zip.1.
22. Made FNMAX 256 for MSDOS (is 1024 otherwise).
23. Used the "pyr" predefined symbol for Pyramid systems in tailor.h.
24. Added Greg's VMS mods to ship.c.  Added help to ship.c (-h or -?).
    Changed meaning of -nnn arg from lines to K.
25. Moved ZMEM routines to fileio.c to properly include them in zipnote and
    zipsplit.
26. Added -s option to ship to specify a subject line prefix.
27. Fixed -z in zip to not trash leading blank lines in the comment.
28. Made ship recognize "unship" in argv[0] a little more flexibly.
29. Made sure temporary zip files are closed before being deleted by an
    error or interrupt.
30. Added a new temporary file interface and new source files tempf.c and
    tempf.h.  This avoids making temporary files for small (<16k) output.
    Both shrink and implode use this.
31. Added OS/2 patches, files.  However, left zip case-sensitive for OS/2
    names, as in Unix.
32. Removed amdahl target in makefile, using UTS symbol instead.
33. Changed -y to depend on definition of S_IFLNK.
34. Avoid leading periods on lines in ship output by inserting a space.
35. Ship is now extensible: added a warning for "unsupported keyword".
    Such keywords can appear before the "ship" line, for example.
36. Added -g option to allow "growing" the zip file.  If just adding new
    entries to a zip file, -g will write over the old zip file without
    creating a temporary.  The danger is that if there is an error, the
    old zip file will be lost.  If not just adding, then -g is ignored.
37. Added aux (A/UX) target to makefile.
38. In shrink.c, removed unnecessary FreeList and ClearList arrays, and
    the recursive Prune() routine.  This also resulted in a speedup in
    shrink of about 15%.  It is now only about 30% slower than Unix compress.
39. Added -q option for quiet operation.
------------------------ Sep 21  1991   version 1.0 ------------------------
Hello world!

This is the first public release version of Zip and its cohort utilities.
We hope you enjoy using it much much more than we enjoyed writing it and
trying to get it to work on every fritzing raffing bliffing nobbin Unix
system in the galaxy.

Please feel free to send any problems, complaints, suggestions, kudos,
ridicule, or whatever to zip-bugs@cs.ucla.edu.  If there were a way to
send cookies over the net, we'd accept those too.

Thank yew fer yur support.

Changes from 0.9 to 1.0:

1.  Removed some pesky carriage returns masquerading as spaces in fileio.c
    and zipup.c.

3.  Compile ship in doturboc.bat.
4.  Miscellaneous zip.1 (zip.doc) changes.
5.  Fixed mistake in stamp() in fileio.c (didn't double seconds).
6.  Applied Jean-Loup's mods for Cray's (do not assume 16-bit shorts).
7.  Removed pyramid make option, since #ifdef pyr seems to work.
8.  Added some casts to tempf.c to clean up some warnings.
9.  Added comment to makefile.exp saying what it is.
10. Removed length checks in zipup.c to fix problem with using Vax variable
    record length formats.
11. Fixed VMS replace-across-devices problem.

17. Added aix make target.
18. Fixed zipsplit.idx to start counting at one like the file names.
19. Changed -a (append VMS version number) to -w to leave -a open for a
    possible future option.
20. Back to separate makefiles for Microsoft and Borland (.msc and .bor).
21. Workaround in fileio.c for Borland stat() bug: stat() succeeds for wild
    card names that match existing files.
22. Added "(did you remember to use binary mode when you transferred it?)"
    to the "probably not a zip file" warning.
23. Changed utilities to append .zip only when the zip file name does not
    contain a dot.
24. At least mentioned the other utilities in zip.doc (zipcloak, ship, etc.),
    and documented upper case matching of names when using -d under MSDOS.
25. Fixed bug in MSDOS version: zip foo c:autoexec.bat wouldn't work.
26. Added hidden/system attribute bug to BUGS in zip.1
27. Fixed recognition of unship in ship when unship is in a path.
28. Added non-stream-LF VMS bug to zip.1 bug list.
29. Fixed bug in #23 above when path has dots.  Documented #23 in zip.1.

1.  On VMS, create new zip files in fixed length 512 format
2.  Call VMSmunch only if the zip file existed previously
3.  Avoid mktemp() and use simpler name for temporary file.
4.  Rename dir_os2.[ch] -> os2zip.[ch]
5.  On MSDOS, use fdopen() after setmode() in zip.c
    Added setmode() for stdin in zipup.c
6.  Do not split #if on two lines (some compilers don't like this)
7.  __MSDOS__ instead of __BORLANDC__ in crypt.c
8.  Added (char*) cast in deflate.c to avoid warning
9.  OS/2 support for storing file attributes in an extra field.

------------------------ June 6  1992   version 1.8a ------------------------
1.  Fixed bug in tempname() for VMS
2.  Fixed type problems in zipup.c for gcc under VMS
3.  Added VMSmunch in vms subdirectory and updated makefile (descrip.mms)
4.  The extra field for OS/2 is now compressed (Kai Uwe Rommel)
5.  Added various fixes for djgcc (Onno van der Linden)
6.  Fixed long standing bug in wild() for MSDOS (Jon Saxton)
7.  Added support for ZIPOPT environment variable (Bill Davidsen
    and Antoine Verheijen).

13. In makefile.os2, support for $(FP), masm 5.x, match.s (Greg & Kai)
14. Added -w-cln in makefile.bor to avoid warning (David Kirschbaum)
15. VMS echo suppression code incorporated (Greg Roelofs)
16. Added fix to match.asm if WSIZE != 32768
17. Create .exe files directly for target scodos (Bill Davidsen)
18. Fixed the -0 bug (compressed size was doubled)
19. Changed -- (read names from stdin) to -@ to reserve -- for undoing
    the effects of ZIPOPT
20. Create zip entries for directories with the -r option, so that
    directory attributes can be saved. (Kai Uwe Rommel)

------------------------ June 17  1992   version 1.8b ------------------------
1.  Changed -s (Software license) to -L (license) to avoid clash
    with the old shrink option.
2.  read_buf declared as extern only in zip.h
3.  avoid warnings in zip.c for Turbo C: while ((ch = *s) != '\0'
4.  suppressed unused variables mem_inbuf and mem_outbuf in bits.c
5.  Speed up the search for start of zip structures (pksfx files)
6.  Allow updates of an empty pksfx file (original file was destroyed)
7.  Keep correct offsets for pksfx files
8.  On MSDOS, in2ex() was updating the input argument. Also, do not
    force upper case: keep the name as it was in the old zip file.
    This is important for -f. Similarly, force lower case in ex2in()
    on MSDOS, except when dosify (-k) is imposed. I kept however the
    old code under the flag FORCE_UPPER in case I goofed.
9.  When growing a zip file with -g and interrupting it, the whole file was
    lost. We now attempt to restore the previous state of the file.
10. "zip -fo jjj", where jjj is a non-existent zipfile, used to dump core.
    We now emit a warning.
11. More generally, we emit a warning for all options assuming the presence
    of a zip file (-d,-f,-u,-g) if the zip file did not exist or was empty.
    Idem for "zip -o jjj" on non-existent or empty zip file.
12. Copy also the extended local entry in zipcopy().
13. Updated zip.1 and vms/vms_zip.rnh to describe the new features.
14. Fixed bug in zipsplit (wrong offsets for all files but first)
15. Added match.s, optimized 386 version of longest_match() for Unix and
    32 bit OS/2 (with gas).
16. Added os2/match32.asm, optimized 386 version of longest_match() for
    32 bit OS/2 (for assemblers using Intel syntax). NOT TESTED YET.
17. Added "assume DS: DGROUP" in match.asm to allow SS_NEQ_DS even with MSC.
18. Added include <malloc.h> in tailor.h for Unix. This is required on
    16-bit Unix.
19. Use init_upper() in os2zip.[ch]
20. Switched back to old tempname(): the new one could overwrite an existing
    file, it ignored tempath, and it caused problems on VMS for files with a
    '.' in the name. Kept however the old code if NO_MKTEMP is defined.
21. Use 0x1 instead of (unsigned)1 in definition of HSIZE (one compiler
    does not like the cast in an array definition).
22. Include VMSmunch.h in zip.c
23. On VMS, zip -o screwed up all offsets in pksfx files

------------------------ June 18  1992   version 1.8c ------------------------
1.  Added missing comma in revision.h
2.  invlocal doesn't work on Cray, use mktime instead (Greg Roelofs)
3.  On VMS, use ctx=stm only to read zipfiles, not input files.
4.  Undo change 21 above, which breaks even more compilers
5.  Include dos.h in util.c and fix trivial compilation errors
6.  Undo change 1 of 1.8b: -L already used for OS/2 (Steve Salisbury)
7.  Do not create a zip entry for directory "." (Greg Roelofs)
8.  Avoid core dump when -@ is given before the zip file (and do
    the right thing).

------------------------ June 19  1992   version 1.8d ------------------------
1.  Force calloc to take unsigned values. (Problem with one 16 bit
    compiler on AT&T 6300).
2.  Fixed fileio.c for Convex (Bill Davidsen)
3.  util_ was missing for zipnote and zipsplit in make_vaxc.com (Glenn Andrews)
4.  Added warning in zip.1 and below (do not update encrypted files
    with pkzip 1.10).
5.  Fixed fix 12 of 1.8b. I drink too much. (Confused bit 1 with bit 8).
6.  Updated install.doc
7.  Fixed result type of os2 version of init_upper().
8.  Added makefile entry for AT&T 6300 (Peter Mauzey)
9.  Fixed typo in descrip.mms
10. Removed zipfile.c warning: shift count exceeds width of value shifted
11. Fix enormous bug in init_upper for VMS (upper stayed as zero)

------------------------ June 23  1992   version 1.8e ------------------------
1.  Don't include malloc.h by default (does not exist on VMS)
2.  Define calloc for 16 bit systems (required for AT&T 6300)
3.  Simpler make_vaxc.com (Greg Roelofs)
4.  New vms/descrip.mms and fixes in zipfile.c (Igor)
5.  seekable() must be true for in-memory compression.
6.  Undefine S_IFLNK if NO_SYMLINK (problems with VMS and SCO)
7.  Include descrip.h only once in fileio.c (Mike Freeman)
8.  New os2/match32.asm (untested) and makefile.os2.
9.  Added dosflag in zlist and flist entries, to force MSDOS file
    attributes. It is set if dosify is set, or (under OS/2) for a file
    on a FAT file system which does not have a long name (Kai-Uwe).
10. Added GetFileTime on OS/2 to avoid core dump on bad dates (Kai-Uwe)
11. New vms.c supporting deflation of extra headers

------------------------ June 24  1992   version 1.8f ------------------------
1.  Incorporated (finally!) Mac support. *Untested*. (James E. O'Dell)
2.  Another long awaited change: Atari ST. Also *untested*.
    (martin@atlantic.cs.unb.ca)
3.  New makefile.os2, as usual. (Kai-Uwe)
4.  Support for Watcom C in os2zip.c. *Not yet working*. (Kai-Uwe).
5.  I forgot to output the length for stored blocks...

------------------------ June 29  1992   version 1.8g ------------------------
1.  New os2zip.c and makefile.os2 as usual.
2.  In the VMS makefiles, define the symbols systematically so that
    people won't forget to update them. (Fed up with the reports that
    zip does not accept parameters).
3.  Use -L for software License and -E for Extended attributes
4.  Added -F 1000 in makefile entry for scodos (Bill Davidsen)
5.  Replaced strcmp with namecmp in zip.c for check of zipfile name.
6.  New os2/match32.asm (still not working)
7.  Do not close stdin (check for null ifile in zipup.c).
8.  signal handlers for zip and zipcloak fixed to restore echo for VMS
9.  slightly cleaner VMS echo calls in fileio.c
10. stricmp missing from VMS zipsplit, zipnote:  since UTIL was unused for
    util.c, I used it to specify stricmp only; then I had to change some of
    the makefiles which previously used util_.* to use util.*, and I added
    util_.obj to OBJS and OBJN in all of the VMS makefiles. (Greg)
11. ifdef'd out the debugging commentary in vms.c (Greg)
12. new VMS makefile for use with (free) MAKE/VMS (Greg)
13. Eliminate some compiler warnings from BCC, MSC, gcc (Onno van der Linden)
14. Do not use MSDOS version of init_upper for djgpp (Onno van der Linden)
15. In msdos/makefile.gcc, added util_.o to OBJN and OBJS, and used asm version
    match.o (Onno van der Linden)
16. Added install target in makefile (Alvin Koh)
17. Default makefile entry is named 'all'.
18. fixes to vms.c for gcc (Igor)
19. Define S_IWRITE as S_IWUSR for Minix only (problem on X/OS) (Fulvio Marino)
20. Added xos makefile entry  (Fulvio Marino)
21. In VMS, files without an extension are now stored without the dot (Greg
    and Igor).
22. Save/restore ebx in match.s and match32.asm
23. Fixed MAX_DIST in match.s (the asm code produced different results
    than the C code)
24. Fixed the -b option: allow ENOTSAM instead of EXDEV (used by Turbo C).
25. Do not complain about zip files created on MSDOS with versions of zip
    above 1.0.

------------------------ Aug 14  1992   version 1.9a ------------------------
1.  Changed -S to -L in help screen
2.  Do not declare chmod for aegis (George Grimes)
3.  Cleaner vms/make_gcc.com (Mike Freeman)
4.  Disabled built-in functions for Linux (Arnt Gulbrandsen)
5.  Added a description of the deflation algorithm in algorith.doc.
6.  Removed ship, now distributed separately.
7.  Added the CRC for in-memory compression. The extra-field format is now
    the official PKWare format (Kai-Uwe)
8.  On OS/2, force lower case names for FAT files if -k is not given. (Kai-Uwe)
9.  Allow coutry dependent mapping for upper to lower case. (Kai-Uwe)
10. Use namecmp instead of stricmp which was confusing. (Onno van der Linden)
11. Avoid some warnings in deflate.c (Onno van der Linden)
12. Avoid one warning in crypt.c, and distribute it separately.
13. Call init_upper() for all utilities and add util_.o in makefiles (Kai-Uwe)

------------------------ Aug 18  1992   version 1.9b ------------------------
1.  Fixes for Windows NT (Dave Feinleib)
2.  Avoid two warnings for Ultrix (makefile and fileio.c)
3.  Finally removed the declaration of chmod(), which causes endless
    new patches for each new target.
4.  Allow -L for license in the utilities (zipsplit, zipnote, zipcloak).
5.  Mention funzip in zip.1.
6.  Untabify all sources files (for more reliable context diffs)
7.  Fix bug in trees.c dealing with bit length overflow.
8.  Fix bug in zipup.c when reading from stdin: if (ifile) does not
    produce the expected result.
9.  Avoid duplication of bug list in zip.1 and history.
10. Removed ship from zip.1.

------------------------ Aug 20  1992   version 1.9 ------------------------
1.  Renamed the atari files to avoid name conflicts (for unzip -j).
2.  Don't tell 'use zip -L' in zipnote and zipsplit.
3.  Add a rule for util_.ojb in the msdos and atari makefiles
4.  Fixed compilation option for util_.obj in makefile.msc (msc 5.1 bug)
5.  Added the 'Where' file.
6.  More information about zip in Readme.
7.  Fixed install.doc.
8.  Fixed vms/vms_zip.rnh
9.  Fixed init_upper() in util.c and os2zip.c (Kai-Uwe)

------------------------ Aug 26  1992   version 1.9p1 ------------------------
This is official patch 1 for zip 1.9, not a beta version.

1.  Simplified makefile entry for convex (Rafal Maszkowski)
2.  Do not use 'const' even for djgcc (Onno van der Linden)
3.  Use gcc in linux makefile entry (Arnt Gulbrandsen)
4.  Fix serious bug in -l option (file truncated).
5.  Fix stack problem for OS/2 IBM-C (Kai-Uwe)
6.  Fix serious bug in zipup.c sometimes causing file truncation to zero bytes
    or internal error (Timo Salmi and Robert Tobler)
7.  Do not unlink() directories when running as root (Charles Hannum)
8.  Fix msdos/makefile.bor and msdos/makefile.gcc (Onno van der Linden)


Things to check or to be done (see also BUGS section in zip.1):

- zip should not create 'stored' files with extended local headers

- There is not (yet) a way to undo the effect of ZIPOPT

- Under MSDOS, zip will find hidden and system files, but not set the
  attributes appropriately in the zip file so that unzip can restore them.

- it is possible in weird cases to add a zipfile to itself

- On OS/2, zip refuses to match some names, such as those beginning with an
  exclamation mark. Same for names starting with #, possibly more.
