db source change log begun 3/10/93

Wed Mar 10 15:40:12 1993 PST
		Received db.zip source kit from hal (V000).
		Separated i8086 source into machined-dependent subdirectory.
		Renamed i8086trace.h to mtrace.h.
trace.h
trace0.c
trace6.c
		The received kit would not compile because of trace6.c/incb(),
		where the caddr_t (char *) arg should really have been int.
		Changed definition "off_t sngblsym;" to int to clarify the
		code and changed incb() calls accordingly.
trace.h
trace1.c
		Replaced macro definition "offset" with "offsetof" as
		defined in <stddef.h>.
trace.h
trace[0123456].c
i8086/i8086[abcd].c
i8086/i8086.h
i8086/mtrace.h
		Cosmetic changes: deleted Logs, added comments at head and foot.

Thu Mar 11 16:41:39 1993 PST
Makefile
db.h
db[0123456].c
i8086/i86db[1234].c
i8086/i86db.h
		Renamed source files and munged Makefile accordingly.
		Cleaned up headers and #includes.  Added required casts
		so that it compiles without complaint.
i8086/i86db2.c
		Removed unnecessary (constant) parameters to getmodRM()
		and getsib().  There is probably more of this to be done.

Fri Mar 12 08:54:48 1993 PST
		Replaced hdrinfo struct with new globals magic, is_lout,
		aop_size.  magic should disappear, leaving only is_lout.
		Replaced RM16/RM32 and OPD16/OPD32 with 16/32.

Fri Mar 12 12:51:12 1993 PST
		V4.0.1: added -V VERSION printing, made usage() verbose.
		Added coff_hdr to globals, simplfied various calling
		sequences.

Sat Mar 13 00:09:13 1993 PST
		V4.0.2: disassembler now understands NDP opcodes; not
		quite right yet, but almost.

Sat Mar 13 22:11:58 1993 PST
Makefile
i386/i386[1234].c
		V4.0.3: improved coding and corrected minor bugs.
		Renamed i8086/i86db* to i386/i386db*, munged Makefile.

Mon Mar 15 09:17:51 1993 PST
		V4.0.4: continued coding cleanup.

Wed Mar 17 17:04:38 1993 PST
		V4.0.5:   Allow long symbol names.  Build symbol table in
		memory rather than having to access the disk repeatedly.
		Clean up stack traceback.  Change lots of function names.

Thu Mar 18 17:18:38 1993 PST
		V4.0.6:  Recognize register names and handle them correctly.
		Allow leading '%' on register names; this allows the user
		to distinguish function "eax()" from register "%eax".
		Added interactive prompt; default is "db :", use option
		"-p prompt" to change it.

Fri Mar 19 23:45:23 1993 PST
		V4.0.7:  Added output type 'N' for NDP registers.
		Improved single-stepping speed by getting only required
		register information.
Makefile
		Modified to specify -VNDP and -f for fp output.
i386/i386dbs.s
		Added machine-language support to fetch NDP 80-bit value.
		
Thu Mar 25 14:47:40 1993 PST
		V4.0.8:  Made breakpoints work, including :br.
		Added :h option to print help info.
		Added :rN option to dump fp registers.

Fri Mar 26 17:19:51 1993 PST
		V4.0.9:  Make "printf:b\n:e\n:c\n" work as expected.
		Made core files work.  Improved traceback.
		Changed "long" to "ADDR_T" for general sanity in source.

Tue Mar 30 07:56:28 1993 PST
		V4.1.0:  Source cleanup continues.  Made "map_set()"
		calls comprehensible.  More uniform output formats.

Thu Apr  1 15:46:54 1993 PST
		V4.1.1:  Ignore COFF N_ABS sections.  Print [+-] infinity,
		NaN and Denormals more appropriately.  Improved helpinfo().
		Rearranged headers and picked lint so gcc compiles silently.

Fri Apr  2 02:08:26 1993 PST
		V4.1.2:  Replaced s_type with s_segn in SYM.  Much cleanup
		of segmentation bogosity; in particular it now generally
		finds the right segment rather than printing "Addressing error".
		Segment mapping for l.out works again, having been broken
		by inadvertently deleting a line sometime this week.

Mon Apr  5 09:20:47 1993 PDT
		V4.1.3:  More minor cleanup of segmentation code.

Mon Apr  5 09:22:49 1993 PDT
		Fixed rest_syscall() system call handling to work
		correctly at sigreturn, where the system call does not return
		to the following instruction.

Thu Apr 15 13:39:58 1993 PDT
i386/i386db3.c
		Added i486 opcodes to disassembler.

Tue Apr 20 14:50:32 1993 PDT
db.h
		V4.1.4: added OLD_CORE compilation switch to header.
		hal improved the core file format 4/93 for COHERENT V4.0.1r75.
		Compiling without -DOLD_CORE builds db which groks
		only the new format.  Compiling with -DOLD_CORE builds db
		which groks both old and new formats.
		This should disappear when the old format becomes irrelevant.
db1.c
		Modified set_core to understand new core file format,
		with or without dumped text segment.  Deciding if the text
		segment is present is a kludge, since no flag is set.

Tue Apr 20 14:55:31 1993 PDT
		V4.1.5: Changed "%x" to "%X" in format strings.
		Changed default format for COFF data and user segments
		from "w" to "l".  Added sample invocations to usage message.
		Fixed bug reported by hal: "0x400000?" gave bogus "addressing
		error".  Added "clearerr()" call in getputb() on failure,
		to prevent bogus "addressing error" on subsequent calls.
		Added failure checks to fseek() calls.
