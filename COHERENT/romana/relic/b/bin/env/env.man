env - execute a command in an environment

usage: env [-] [VARIABLE=value ...] [command args]

Executes "command" with "args", modifying the existing environment
by doing the requested assignments.  The "-" option means that the
environment should be _replaced_ with the list assignements, otherwise
the assignments are added to the environment.
If "command" is ommitted, the resulting environment is printed.
