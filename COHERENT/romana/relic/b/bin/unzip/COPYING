  Additional copyright information:

     BILF (distributed with the VMS stuff) is copyrighted by Rahul Dhesi,
     but it is freely distributable.

     The functions extract_or_test_files() and store_info() in extract.c,
     do_string() and return_VMS() in misc.c, VMS version of echo() in
     file_io.c, and find_end_central_dir() in unzip.c, were written by
     Greg Roelofs and subsequently modified by many others via Info-ZIP.
     I do not claim a copyright on these routines, but I do ask that no
     one else do so either, :-) and that anyone using them in other pro-
     grams note their source.

     The function decrypt_member() in extract.c and the password functions
     in file_io.c were written by Mark Adler, as were the inflate.c and
     explode.c modules.

     The function mapped_name() in mapname.c was written by David Kirschbaum,
     based on the XXU program by Frank Da Cruz.

     The module match.c was written by J. Kercheval and modified by David
     Kirschbaum for use in UnZip.

     Original notes from unzip 2.0a by Carl Mascott, cmascott@world.std.com
     (these are only the modifications which seem still to exist):
        * 12/14/89  C. Mascott  2.0a   adapt for UNIX
        *              don't pre-allocate output file space
        *              implement -t, -v, member file specs
        *              buffer all input
        *              fix "Bad CRC" msg: good/bad CRCs were swapped
        *              check for write error on output file

     Most of the remaining routines have contributions from all of us, and
     show it. :-)

   Info-ZIP comments:

   Info-ZIP has very little interest in legal matters, aside from the usual
   "CYA" sense (that's an acronym, and you can figure it out yourself :-) ).

   As far as we are aware--and please note that the numerous contributors 
   and copyright holders make this a little uncertain--the UnZip code is now 
   "clean" in the sense that an UnZip executable may be distributed with a
   commercial product SO LONG AS IT IS CLEAR THAT UNZIP IS NOT BEING SOLD,
   THAT THE SOURCE CODE IS FREELY AVAILABLE, AND THAT THERE ARE NO EXTRA OR
   HIDDEN CHARGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE BY OR INCLUSION WITH THE COMMERCIAL
   PRODUCT.  In particular, the retroactive copyright on unimplode.c which
   Carl Mascott requested we include in UnZip 4.2 is no longer in force, since
   Mark Adler has rewritten the module in question from scratch (it's about
   twice as fast, too! :-) ).

   Regarding the original copyright by Mr. Smith:  Info-ZIP has finally found
   him again (he's moved to southern California), and he's apparently happy
   with the current code and restrictions.  More specifically, since the 
   current incarnation of UnZip can be considered "our own"--it bears very 
   little resemblance to his original program, in either content or size :-)
   --and since we freely distribute the source code, we believe that we are 
   within the bounds of his third stipulation.

   Info-ZIP continues to rewrite portions of the code as time permits, in an
   effort to eliminate as many of the restrictions (and bugs) as possible.
   The bugs are our primary concern, however, so don't hold your breath. :-)
