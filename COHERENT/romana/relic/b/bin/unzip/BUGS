Bugs (real and/or imagined):
---------------------------

 - Watcom C getch() broken; password echos (reported to Watcom by K.U.Rommel)
 - VMS docs out of date
 - Amiga port broken?
 - VMS unzip no longer sets permissions correctly
 - Macintosh file attributes not interpreted correctly (both unzip, zipinfo)
 - errno declaration conflicts with several compilers' definitions:  change
    logic so undeclared by default?  How many systems affected?
 - (?) add ifndef MODERN around srand, rand prototypes in crypt.c? [James
    Birdsall, 4/23]
 - pkbug error:  zipfile with incorrect csize and/or ucsize--check for end of
    compressed (csize) data in uncompression routines:
      unimplod.c:    while ((!zipeof) && ((outpos + outcnt) < ucsize)) {
      unreduce.c:    while (((outpos + outcnt) < ucsize) && (!zipeof)) {
    (James Birdsall, Mark, bottom of BUGS.long)
 - if PK signature not found, append .zip and try again without error 
    messages (Jean-loup, others, bottom of BUGS.long)
 - disk full:  a few files clear some pointer; continuing beyond "Continue?"
    prompt, regardless of answer, kills unzip--stack too small? (doesn't seem
    to matter)  Bug in MSC write() function?  Subsequent write code isn't any 
    different from -t option, so unlikely to be bug in uncompress routines...
    File descriptor bad/close() failure?  (workaround:  ^C at prompt)
 - textfile conversions on a PC system add extra CR to lines which already have
    CR/LF combo; other directions probably don't work, either (Mac/Unix/...):
    rewrite "dos2unix" and make general
 - compressed symlinks are allowed:  revise symlink code
 - fix "no errors detected" message for errors occurring *before* extract_or_
    test_files(); count errors?  differentiate between errors and warnings?


Features (possible and/or definite):
-----------------------------------

 - add -x "exclude following files" option to unzip and zipinfo
 - make use of FILE_IO_C and similar defines to avoid including unnecessary
    header files in various modules (unzip.h)
 - add "near" to global vars [Steve Salisbury, 4/21]
 - construct CRC table dynamically? [Jean-loup, 5/12]
 - when listing filenames, use '?' for non-printables? [Thomas Wolff, 6/1]
 - modify to decompress input stream if part of a pipe, but continue using
    central directory if not (BIG job!)--extended local header capability
 - need zipinfo target(s) in makefile.dos
 - build in capability to check text/binary type and warn if -a (if version
    < 1.1 and not made on DOS--i.e., not early Info-ZIP versions)
 - allow wildcards in zipfile name (loop through each one)
 - test/incorporate Martin Schulz optimization patch (still useful?)
 - add -oo option (overwrite and override):  no user queries (if bad password,
    skip file; if disk full, take default action; if VMS special on non-VMS,
    unpack anyway; etc.)
 - add -Q[Q[Q]] option (quiet mode on comments, cautions, warnings and errors):
    forget -oo, or make synonym?  Default level -Q?
 - incorporate Atari patches
 - rewrite mapname()
 - modify set_file_time routines to share common code (macro?)
 - add zipinfo "in-depth" option? (check local vs. central filenames, etc.)
 - create zipcat program to concatenate zipfiles
 - create zipfix program to rebuild/salvage damaged zipfiles
 - assembly-language routines?
 - add -i (ignore case for internal filename match) option?  (maybe not)
 - CP/M version (Jeffery Foy)
 - VM/CMS version (Chua Kong Sian, others)
 - put man pages in more "proper" nroff format
 - add OS/2 .INF format helpfiles for UnZip and ZipInfo
