NAME
     funzip - extract from a ZIP archive file as a filter

SYNOPSIS
     [...]  |  funzip [ password ]  |  [...]

ARGUMENTS
     [password]  Optional password to be used if ZIP  archive  is
                 encrypted.   Decryption  may not be supported at
                 some sites.  See DESCRIPTION for more details.

DESCRIPTION
     FUnZip acts as a filter; that is,  it  assumes  that  a  ZIP
     archive  is being piped into standard input, and it extracts
     the first member from the archive to stdout.  Given the lim-
     itation  on  single-member extraction, FUnZip is most useful
     in conjunction with a secondary  archiver  program  such  as
     tar(1).   The  following  section includes an example illus-
     trating this usage in the case of disk backups to tape.

EXAMPLES
     To use FUnZip to  extract  the  first  member  file  of  the
     archive test.zip and to pipe it into more(1):

          funzip < test.zip | more

     To use FUnZip to test the first member file of test.zip (any
     errors will be reported on standard error):

          funzip < test.zip > /dev/null

     To use Zip and FUnZip in place of  compress(1)  and  zcat(1)
     for tape backups:

          tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k

          dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

     (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

LIMITATIONS
     There is presently no way to  extract  any  member  but  the
     first  from a ZIP archive.  This would be useful in the case
     where a ZIP archive is included within another archive.

     An alternate mechanism for passing the  password  to  FUnZip
     would be preferable to putting it on the command line.

     FUnZip would be useful under OS/2, too.

     The functionality of FUnZip  should  be  included  in  UnZip
     directly (future release).
