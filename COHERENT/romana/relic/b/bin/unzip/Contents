Files marked "required*" are also needed to compile ZipInfo.  There are Unix
and MS-DOS targets to make ZipInfo in Makefile (zipinfo, zi_indigo, zi_gcc, 
zi_dos).  FUnZip is a new program of limited capabilities; for now, it can 
only extract the first member in a zipfile from stdin and send it to stdout,
and only if the member is either deflated or stored.  It works under Unix,
OS/2 and MS-DOS, at least, although it doesn't appear in all of the makefiles
yet.  It may eventually be absorbed into UnZip itself.

The Atari ST support is in the form of patches against UnZip 4.1; there
are more details in the ATARI sub-archive Contents file.  Amiga support
is only partial for this release, but full support is almost complete in 
the current UnZip 5.1 betas.
