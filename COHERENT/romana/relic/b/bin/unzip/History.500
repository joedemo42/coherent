   v1.2 Toad Hall Tweak, Apr 92

 - Adapting to Info-ZIP unzip (to replace SEA's match() code).
   Why?  To avoid any future copyright problems.  (Hopefully one day
   we'll have EVERYTHING built of public domain code.)
   An even greater hope: that this new code added functionality
   and didn't break *too* many old applications.

 - Incorporating FILMATCH.H code herein.
 - Consolidated all test code at the end (#ifdef'ed out, of course)
   so we can throw it all away when we're done playing.
 - Swapping *string and *pattern to match previous match() parms.
 - [GRR:  renamed from "filmatch.c" to "match.c" to avoid changing
   all of the unzip makefiles]

   From the previous match()'s comments:

   "The match() routine recursively compares a string to a "pattern" (regular
   expression), returning TRUE if a match is found or FALSE if not.
   This version is specifically for use with unzip.c:  as did the previous
   SEA's match(), it leaves the case (upper, lower, or mixed) of the string
   alone, but converts any uppercase characters in the pattern to lowercase
   if indicated by the global var pInfo->lcflag (which is to say, string is
   assumed to have been converted to lowercase already, if such was
   necessary)."

   Since the above has approached or exceeded unintelligibility
   (why use small words when big ones will do?), scan down for "lcflag"
   and see what the code does.

==================

These changes occurred in beta versions 5.0a to 5.0p.  This list may have 
left out some bugfixes and even some features...the brain cell is going, 
folks (as Mark would say).  Apologies, etc., but I did muh best....
