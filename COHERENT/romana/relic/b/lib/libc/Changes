i8086/i386 libc source change log, begun 1/4/93
Earlier changes are in libc/Changes.1992.

Mon Jan  4 16:42:19 1993 PST
gen/copyright.c
		V4.1.14: bumped copyright date to include 1993.
sys/execvpe.c
		Changed default shell DEFSHELL ("sh") to SHELL ("/bin/sh")
		to fix bug reported by vlad.

Tue Jan  5 16:29:49 1993 PST
gen/mktemp.c
		V4.1.15: rewritten after user Udo Monk reported mktemp() suffix
		caused problem when result string was used to construct a
		call to system().  Old source generated 91 distinct suffixes
		(all but control, SP, DEL, *, ?, `), the new 63 ([a-zA-Z0-9_).

Mon Jan 11 17:58:20 1993 PST
gen/getpwent.c
		V4.1.16: set pw_comment field instead of pw_gecos,
		which it previously set, to fix bug reported by Udo Monk.

Wed Jan 13 13:34:32 1993 PST
		V4.1.17: recompilation with merged NDP sources and updated
		compiler, no substantive changes.

Wed Jan 13 15:42:28 1993 PST
crt/i387/rts87.s
		V4.1.18: change fdiv/fsub ops for consistency with
		cef's assembler changes, for Unix compatability.

Mon Jan 25 16:43:03 1993 PST
gen/atof.c
gen/strtod.c
		V4.1.19: modified to ignore trailing zeros after '.'.
		Before, e.g. "2.00000000000000000" convertsion produced
		incorrect low-order bit (because scaling by 10E-n is not
		precise).

Tue Jan 26 10:15:28 1993 PST
sys/i386/wait.s
		Changes from hal to implement both wait() and waitpid().
crt/i387/rts87.s
		Added _fwait (fwait; ret) in case the user wants to
		explicitly force coprocessor synchronization.
gen/malloc/malloc.h
		Added ulimit(3) call to set upper bound on sbrk() calls.
		Also changed <sys/malloc.h> DECRSIZE from 256 to 4096.

Tue Jan 26 13:12:11 1993 PST
stdio/*
		Changed to ANSI-compliant stdio source base, with
		corresponding change to <stdio.h>, invalidating all old
		unlinked objects and libraries.

Thu Jan 28 14:33:19 1993 PST
stdio/_stropen.c
		Initialize the FILE structure for sprintf/sscanf more
		carefully.  cef discovered sscanf() bug due to failure to
		initialize the FILE flags correctly, resulting in bogus EOF.

Fri Jan 29 09:50:04 1993 PST
stdio/sprintf.c
		V4.1.21: simplified to call vsprintf().
stdio/vsprintf.c
		_FILE2 was not initialized correctly.

Fri Jan 29 11:21:10 1993 PST
stdio/_finit.c
		V4.1.22: fixed mode for unbuffered stdin input.

Mon Feb  1 15:19:30 1993 PST
sys/i386/Makefile
		V4.1.23: hal's recent wait.s change made label "done" visible;
		added -x to ASFLAGS in the make to make it disappear.

Mon Feb  8 09:42:29 1993 PST
stdio/_scanf.c
stdio/vfprintf.c
		V4.1.24: Corrected conditionalization which caused printf()
		to print all int values with 16 bits, not 32.  Fixed "%p"
		conversions to 8 hex character width.

Tue Feb  9 10:20:09 1993 PST
stdio/_fgetb.c
		V4.1.25: Corrected bug causing _fgetb() to not return EOF
		when it should.
