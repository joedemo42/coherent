 * C general utilities library.
 * qsort()
 * ANSI 4.10.5.2.
 * Quicksort.
 * Algorithm from C. A. R. Hoare, cf. Knuth Vol. 3, pp. 114 ff.
 */

/*
 * qsort chooses a pivot element (Knuth recommends random choice),
 * partitions the input into sets less than and greater than the pivot,
 * puts the pivot into the correct slot in the sorted set,
 * and recursively sorts the two subpartitions.
 * For small numbers of elements, a linear insertion sort is more efficient.
 * The obvious recursive implementation of qsort can easily use a lot of
 * stack space.  The nonrecursive implementation here is less obvious
 * but more efficient.  It is based on two observations:
 * (1) Using ordinary recursion on the smaller of the subpartitions and
 * tail recursion on the larger reduces recursion nesting to at most
 * log2(nmemb) levels.  This reduces stack usage enormously.
 * (2) Since the maximum number of recursion levels is known by (1),
 * the recursion can be faked with auto arrays of fixed size.
 * This provides additional efficiency because the constant
 * "size" and "compar" args need not be passed recursively.
