i8086/i386 libc source change log, begun 5/6/92

Wed May  6 14:31:23 1992 PDT
crt/Makefile
crt/i386/Makefile
crt/i386/_prof.c
crt/i8086/Makefile
crt/i8086/_prof.c
		i386 ld now writes e.g. "__end_text" rather than "etext",
		so split _prof.c into i386 and i8086 versions appropriately.
crt/i386/fdcvt.s
		Corrected bug in double -> float conversion.
gen/Makefile
gen/_addargs.c
gen/coffnlist.c
		Added _addargs() and coffnlist().
gen/i386/Makefile
gen/i386/alloca.s
		Added alloca().
gen/qsort.c
gen/shellsort.c
		Replaced qsort() and shellsort() with new sources from cef,
		with better performance.
sys/i386/brk.s
		Changed end to __end for consistency with ld.
sys/i386/mkscall.c
		Eliminated extraneous "orl %eax, %eax" in system call
		generation routine.
sys/i386/scall.s5
		Added system call poll (87).
sys/i386/msgemul.c
		Corrected by Bob H. by adding missing arguments.
sys/i386/shmemul.c
		Corrected by Bob H.
sys/i386/Makefile
sys/i386/uname.c
sys/i386/ustat.c
		Added stubs as requested by hal.

Thu May  7 10:19:55 1992 PDT
gen/Makefile
gen/_cleanup.c
		Added _cleanup() which currently does nothing,
		as requested by norm.  This is required for linking
		some ATT programs.

Thu May  7 16:03:44 1992 PDT
crt/i386/modf.c
		Corrected result for negative arguments.  For the old
		version, -1.15 returned -2.00 + .85 rather than -1 + -.15.
		The change is consistent with ANSI 4.5.4.6.

Tue May 12 15:45:46 1992 PDT
Makefile
ndir/Makefile
ndir/*.c
sys/i386/Makefile
		Added SV-style directory access routines in directory ndir.
		Modified Makefile accordingly.  Deleted getdents.o from
		system call object list in i386/Makefile, for now.

Thu May 21 14:28:58 1992 PDT
crt/i386/daddsub.s
		Promula reported a bug in floating point output,
		which was really a bug in floating point subtract.
		When the operands differed in precisely the 20th
		significant bit, the result was normalized incorrectly.

Fri May 22 13:39:32 1992 PDT
stdio/_dtefg.c
		Corrected modf() call; the 5/7/92 change above changed
		the results of modf() for negative arguments,
		this compensates for that change.

Tue May 26 13:25:29 1992 PDT
gen/ctime.c
		Added ftime(), previously missing, after modifying source
		provided by michael.

Thu May 28 16:28:29 1992 PDT
csu/i386/crts0.s
		Added runtime startoff source.

Fri May 29 13:58:04 1992 PDT
crt/i386/dmul.s
		Corrected after bug report from Promula: when rounding
		result carried past hidden bit, I decrmented the exponent
		when I should have incremented it.

Thu Jun  4 12:55:38 1992 PDT
gen/sys_err.c
		Added _I386 conditional to correspond to COH386 <errno.h>.

Tue Jun  9 16:43:42 1992 PDT
gen/Makefile
gen/lockf.c
		Added lockf.c and added lockf.o to Makefile.

Fri Jun 19 14:48:55 1992 PDT
gen/getwd.c
		Renamed getwd() to _getwd(), to avoid conflict with BSD
		getwd() which expects different arguments.
gen/Makefile
gen/getcwd.c
		Added getcwd(), modified Makefile accordingly.
