libm/i387 source change log, begun 10/26/92

Mon Oct 26 11:09:36 1992 PST
		Initial version.  Steve modified the existing i8087 NDP
		routines 10/19-23/92, including conversion of the old .m
		sources to current assembler format and simplification of
		many routines by using i80x87 opcodes which were not present
		in the i8087.  Appears to work, but not heavily tested.

Makefile
		Added pol.o and j[01n].o, previously missing,
		using common C sources.
