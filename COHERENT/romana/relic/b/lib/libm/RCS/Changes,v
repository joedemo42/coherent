libm source change log begun 5/22/92

Fri May 22 13:15:18 1992 PDT
ceil.c
cos.c
floor.c
pow.c
tan.c
two.c
		Corrected sources to reflect corrected modf() return value
		for negative arguments; e.g. for arg -1.9,
		modf() used to return intpart -2. and fracpart .1,
		now (correctly) it returns intpart -1. and fracpart -.9.
		Other minor cosmetic changes.

Tue Jun  9 17:23:40 1992 PDT
sin.c
sinh.c
tanh.c
		Added code to return arg unchanged when less that THRESHOLD
		in absolute value after Promula reported inaccuracy for very
		small arguments.

Wed Jun 10 14:37:37 1992 PDT
sin.c
		Another change by cef: below THRESHOLD, sin(x) now uses
		Taylor's Series, rather than just returning x.

Mon Oct 26 11:09:36 1992 PST
i387/*
		Initial version.  Steve modified the existing i8087 NDP
		routines 10/19-23/92, including conversion of the old .m
		sources to current assembler format and simplification of
		many routines by using i80x87 opcodes which were not present
		in the i8087.  Appears to work, but not heavily tested.

Wed Dec  2 13:43:01 1992 PST
i387/Makefile
		Added pol.o and j[01n].o, previously missing,
		using common C sources.

Wed Jan 13 16:00:25 1993 PST
i387/acos87.s
i387/asin87.s
i387/exp87.s
i387/tanh87.s
		Change fdiv/fsub ops in keeping with cef's as change,
		for Unix compatability.
