/*
 * This is where we build the external->internal major number mapping table.
 *
 * The external->internal device number system becomes immediately useful
 * under STREAMS, where a) STREAMS cannot use device major numbers lower than
 * MAJOR_RESERVED under Coherent, and b) Coherent uses old-style 16-bit
 * dev_t's, so that the ability to transform a range of external majors into
 * a contiguous sequence of internal minor numbers will be of immediate value
 * in supporting connection-oriented services (although this is also pending
 * on the addition of support for cloning to the kernel).
 *
 * Mapping between internal and external numbers is not simple; what makes it
 * worse is that because there is a single mapping that has to be the same
 * for both block and character tables, the construction of the bdevsw [] and
 * cdevsw [] internal tables is constrained. This is only a problem if
 * multiple external major numbers are allowed, and each device is only
 * permitted to have a single internal major number. The interpretation of the
 * 'M' flag in this circumstance is unclear.
 *
 * The assign_imajors () code should be able to deal with the most complex
 * case, which is where multiple external majors may actually be mapped to
 * multiple internal numbers, thus
 *
 *	Block external :            |-----scsi-------|
 *	Character external:   |--tcp--| |-udp-|  |ttys|
 *
 * Might map 'tcp' to internal 0, 'udp' to internal 1, 'ttys' to internal 2,
 * while 'scsi' would have 0, 1, and 2 as internal major numbers.
 *
 * This is all hypothetical at the moment, since multiple majors are new to
 * Coherent anyway. For simplicity, we may constrain the above to be an error
 * by requiring unique internal number for each device. However, the machinery
 * in assign_imajors () will have to be flexible enough to deal with the
 * above.
 *
 * NOTE: The complex model is only applicable if a device does not care what
 * minor numbers are given to it, since there is a single shared table used
 * to map a range of external major numbers into a range of internal minor
 * numbers. Since this table is shared, it constrains even more heavily the
 * circumstances in which numbers can overlap. Without a flag to detect when
 * a driver doesn't care about minor numbers, we simply forget about the
 * complex model.
 */

/*
 * Definitions used to control parts of the way assign_imajors () deals with
 * the external->internal mapping (as discussed above). The main things we
 * isolate here are the calculations of the upper bounds for table allocations
 * since the constraint of a common mapping means that the cdevsw [] and
 * bdevsw [] tables may be larger than a separate mapping would permit.
 *
 * In particular, if ncdevs is the number of character devices and nbdevs is
 * the number of block devices, the upper bound on table size is:
 *	Simple model:	block = char = max (ncdevs, nbdevs)
 *     Complex model:	char = ncdevs + max (nbdevs - 1, 0)
 *			block = nbdevs + max (ncdevs - 1, 0)
