/*
 * The dial command is the principle string that must be built.
 * The routines will build a dial command as follows:
 *
 *      <CS><DS><phone-number><DE><CE>
 *
 * Note that the DE and CE strings are present ALWAYS.
 * This procedure will be used to dial phone numbers if the DI flag is true.
 * If this isn't the way to dial numbers,
 * DO NOT SET DI IN THE MODEMCAP FILE!!!
 */

/*
 * a hangup command will be performed as follows:
 *
 *      1). any attention string (AT) will be sent followed by the delay (AD)
 *      2). modem should now be in command state, send hangup (HU) command
 *      3). send initialization string (IS) followed by the delay (ID)
 *
 * It is important that you determine a correct AT and HU string
 *  to perform this function.
 * If the modem hangs up when DTR falls (even if there is a HU string),
 *  declare the flag HC (for Hangup on Close).
