@pax.cnv.log - Log of PAX conversion to Coherent.

90/05/25  hws   Initial version
90/06/04  vlad

o build gwin-dir-lib from usenet - but since Coherent already has a
  header called dirent.h in /usr/include, change the new header to the other
  common name for it, ndir.h;  also add a new header called dirent.h to
  /usr/include/sys.  The new routines were put in /usr/lib/libdir.a so LDFLAGS
  in Makefile got defined to -ldir and LDFLAGS was added to the compilation
  rule.

o change  #include <dirent.h>  to  #include <ndir.h> (pax.h)

o change #include <fcntl.h> to #include <sys/fcntl.h> (pax.h)

o remove #include <memory.h> from port.h

o remove ioctl.h

o change  #ifdef __STDC__  to  #if __STDC__ (#ifndef __STDC__  and 
  #if defined __STDC__)
  because argument lists are checked when this conditional succeeds but
  __STDC__ is defined to be 0 by mwc cc;  similarly for #ifndef __STDC__

o config.h - various mods that get rid of double comments
  changes:	not define TTY (l. 81);
		not define PAXDIR (l. 91);
		not define BSD;
		define DIRENT = -ldir (l. 102);
		define OFFSET off_t (l. 111);
		not define void (l. 122);
		define SIG_T int (l. 131);
		not define STRCSPN (l. 141);
		was removed extra /* (l. 154);
		was included in '/*' ' */' (l. 162);
o *.c header names were changed or includes were commented out, e.g.:
    <sys/errno.h> -> <errno.h>
    <memory.h> was not included; the needed declarations are in <string.h>

o printf format strings referring to asb->sb_size in tar_entry() in list.c
  had format changed from %d to %ld

o Because COHERNT "open" is V7 "open" were made changes in the files
  buffer.c, fileio.c, paxdir.c, ttyio.c, & opendir.

o pax.c - added message TAR(v7) for old tapes archive.

o In append.c was added lseek(archivefd, -((OFFSET) blocksize), 1). It was
  done because ustar started write in the file one block later than 
  had to started in the append case.

o ustar does not work with 'u' option. According to this was deleted all
  stuff that had any relation to 'u'. From "pax.c" - "short	newer",
  from "tar.c" - "case u", 'u' from taropt's option string, f_newer from
  check command line, and prompt from "usage()".

o ustar.c
  ustar had default blocking factor for extract 20 bl. This number was
  in "#define DEF_BLOCKING 20". Now it is "define DEF_BLOCKING 1".
 
o ustar, pax, & cpio want have a big stack for working with directory
  tree. I think that "fixstack +2000 ustar" could help them. 

o for distinguish between COHERENT "tar" and new "tar" the name for new
  was changed to "ustar". For this was replacemented "tar" to "ustar"
  in:
pax.c:     if (strcmp(myname, "ustar")==0) {
pax.c: 	    if (strcmp(optarg, "ustar") == 0) {
pax.c:     } else if (strncmp(&bufstart[257], "ustar", 5) == 0) {

pax.h: #define TMAGIC		"ustar"		/* ustar and a null */
pax.h:  * Exit codes from the "ustar" program 

ustar.c:  * ustar.c - tar specific functions for archive handling
ustar.c: /* do_tar - main routine for ustar. 
ustar.c: /* taropt -  ustar specific getopt

	Makefile
# BINDIR - points to the directory in which you want the final pax, ustar and
MISC   = Makefile pax.1 ustar.5 cpio.5 README PATCHLEVEL
	port.c regexp.c replace.c ustar.c ttyio.c warn.c wildmat.c
	port.o regexp.o replace.o ustar.o ttyio.o warn.o wildmat.o $(DIROBJ)
PROGS = pax ustar cpio
PMAN1 = pax.1 ustar.1
PMAN5 = pax.5 ustar.5
ustar: pax
	rm -f ustar
	ln pax ustar

o Because 'r' cannot work with tape were added the code for 
  checking major number in the case of append (file fileio.c)

#define TAPE_DEV 12	/* Tape's major number */
	if (stat(ar_file, &ap_stat) == -1)
		fatal("cannot define the attributes of a file\n");
	if (major(ap_stat.st_rdev) == TAPE_DEV)
		fatal("option 'r' does not work with tape\n");

o	The was bug in ttyio.c. cpio takes input from stdin and redirect
	it to stdout. The result is that original cpio can not creat
	multiple volume backups. Some code were added to funcition 
	void next() to allow to do multiple volume backups

BUGS
====

o The problem is when we try to use ustar(pax or cpio) on big directories.
  This program keeps file's names in the data segment. When total number of 
  names is big enough, it cannot allocate memory for new directory's entries.
  Problem is similar to trouble with "unmkfs". 
  "ustar" (pax, cpio) could create archives about 1.7 - 2 Mb.
