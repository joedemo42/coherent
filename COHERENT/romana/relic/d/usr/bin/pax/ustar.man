          The following options are available:

          ----cccc        Creates a new archive; writing begins at the
                    beginning of the archive, instead of after the
                    last file.

          ----rrrr        Writes names files to the end of the archive.

          ----tttt        Lists the names of all of the files in the
                    archive.

          ----uuuu        Causes named files to be added to the archive if
                    they are not already there, or have been modified
                    since last written into the archive.  This implies
                    the ----rrrr option.

          ----xxxx        Extracts named files from the archive.  If a named
                    file matches a directory whose contents had been
                    written onto the archive, that directory is
                    recursively extracted.  If a named file in the
                    archive does not exist on the system, the file is
                    create with the same mode as the one in the
                    archive, except that the set-user-id and get-
                    group-id modes are not set unless the user has
                    appropriate privileges.

          If the files exist, their modes are not changed except as
          described above.  The owner, group and modification time are
          restored if possible.  If no _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e argument is given, the
          entire contents of the archive is extracted.  Note that if
          several files with the same name are in the archive, the
          last one will overwrite all earlier ones.

          ----bbbb        Causes _u_s_t_a_r to use the next argument on the
                    command line as the blocking factor for tape
                    records.  The default is 1; the maximum is 20.

                    This option should only be used with raw magnetic
                    tape archives.  Normally, the block size is
                    determined automatically when reading tapes.

          ----ffff        Causes _u_s_t_a_r to use the next argument on the
                    command line as the name of the archive instead of
                    the default, which is usually a tape drive.  If ----
                    is specified as a filename _u_s_t_a_r writes to the
                    standard output or reads from the standard input,
                    whichever is appropriate for the options given.
                    Thus, _u_s_t_a_r can be used as the head or tail of a
                    pipeline.

          ----llll        Tells _u_s_t_a_r to report if it cannot resolve all of
                    the links to the files being archived.  If ----llll is
                    not specified, no error messages are written to
                    the standard output.  This modifier is only valid
                    with the ----cccc, ----rrrr and ----uuuu options.

          ----mmmm        Tells _u_s_t_a_r not to restore the modification times.
                    The modification time of the file will be the time
                    of extraction.  This modifier is invalid with th
                    ----tttt option.

          ----oooo        Causes extracted files to take on the user and
                    group identifier of the user running the program
                    rather than those on the archive.  This modifier
                    is only valid with the ----xxxx option.

          ----vvvv        Causes _u_s_t_a_r to operate verbosely.  Usually, _u_s_t_a_r
                    does its work silently, but the vvvv modifier causes
                    it to print the name of each file it processes,
                    preceded by the option letter.  With the ----tttt
                    option, vvvv gives more information about the archive
                    entries than just the name.

          ----wwww        Causes _u_s_t_a_r to print the action to be taken,
                    followed by the name of the file, and then wait
                    for the user's confirmation.  If a word beginning
                    with yyyy is given, the action is performed.  Any
                    other input means "no".  This modifier is invalid
                    with the ----tttt option.

                    ----iiii or ----yyyy options are specified.
