uuinstall has a number of changes.

The permissions screen looks as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 /usr/lib/uucp/Permissions Items in all lists are separated by : (colon)

 Remote site name !
 Provide an entry for that site calling in <y/n> !
      LOGNAME	  !
 Add an entry to /etc/passwd <y/n> !
 Identify myself as !
 Can the remote site request file transfers from this computer <y/n/c> !
 Can this computer initiate file transfers to the remote site <y/n> !


 Commands which can be executed at this computer by this remote site
   !
 Read directory list
   !
 Exceptions to the read directory list
   !
 Write directory list
   !
 Exceptions to the write directory list
   !
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The !'s are the points where data is entered. The last 5 fields are what
I call long fields. When data is to be entered in a long field a window
comes up at the top which looks like this:

		Data entry for potentially long field
!
!
!
!
!
!

The user enters the long field's data in the window. Entering a null
line ends the long field. A convienient part of the long field is then
displayed on the main screen. A long field may also be left by entering
<ctl-p> from the top of the window or <ctl-n> from the bottom. This
exits the field and goes to the previous or next field. Entering <ctl-z>
finishes the entire screen.

There are two nwe questions on this screen.
  "Add an entry to /etc/passwd <y/n> !"
If this is answered yes when this screen is exited a new entry will be added
to /etc/paswd for the LOGNAME.

 "Identify myself as !"
Is used for a MYNAME= entry. Some systems will want the user to be identified
by a different name than his system name, for example "bbsusr". This allows
an entry in that field.

The L.sys screen now looks as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Connected system list
System		!
Line		!
baud rate	!
phone number	!
Day to call     Time From    Time To     
!		!	     !

expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
expect !                            send !
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The expect and send fields are long fields. It is only nessisary to enter
as many expect, send fields as are required from the top.

While the L.sys screen is up the following help screen is available. For
expect, send data:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|									    |
|	Subentries					Escape Codes        |
An expect entry may take the form	    ""           Expect a null string
expect-subsend-subexpect		    \b                 Send backspace
Where subsend is a possibly		    \c    If send string ends with \c
empty string enclosed in hyphens	        suppress newline after string
to be sent if the expect string		    \d   Delay 1 second after sending
is not recieved. For example:		    \n                 Send a newline
ogin:--ogin:				    \r          Send a carrage return
If ogin: is not recieved send a		    \s                   Send a space
newline and wait for ogin: again	    \t                     Send a tab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
