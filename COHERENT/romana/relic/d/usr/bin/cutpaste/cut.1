.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cut
utility selects portions of each line (as specified by
.Ar list  )
from each
.Ar file
(or the standard input by default), and writes them to the
standard output.
The items specified by
.Ar list
can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited
by a special character. Column numbering starts from 1.
.Pp
.Ar List
is a comma or whitespace separated set of increasing numbers and/or
number ranges.
Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
.Li (``\-'') ,
and a second number
and select the fields or columns from the first number to the second,
inclusive.
Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from 1 to the first number.
Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from the last number to the end of the line.
Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.
It is not an error to select fields or columns not present in the
input line.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Tw Fl
.Tp Cx Fl c
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar list
.Cx
The
.Ar list
specifies character positions.
.Tp Cx Fl f
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar list
.Cx

Output fields are separated by a single tab character.
.Tp Cx Fl d
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar char
.Cx
Use
.Ar char
as the field delimiter character instead of the tab character.
.Tp Fl s
Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.
Unless specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.
.Tp
.Pp
.Nm Cut
exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurred.
