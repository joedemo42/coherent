@Emacs had the following problem, even with ctl-q there were some characters
which couldn't be inserted via the keyboard.

The function esc-q which had been another entry for ctl-q now asks for the
value to insert. This is a decimal number.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changable tabsize has been added. Tabsize consists of two seperate
notions The intrepetation of a tab character from the keyboard and the
intrepetation of a tab character from a file.

Programmers will generally want to change the intrepetation of a tab
character from a file. For example if you like tabs to appear as 3 spaces
rather than 8 you may set this variable two ways. You may export the
shell variable TABSIZ=3. Or you may enter ctl-u -3 ctl-i. Tabsize
settings are saved with your bindings file. ctl-x S will prompt for the
name of your bindings file before saving it, the default bindings file is
at $HOME/.emacs.rc and is loaded if it exists by MicroEMACS at startup.

This leaves the problem of printing listings with modified tab meanings.
The utility detab reads stdin turns tabs to spaces and writes to stdout.
It takes it's tabsize from its first parm, if that is not there from the
enviromental variable TABSIZ, if that is not there it uses 8.

Another solution is to leave the meaning of a tab on a file but change the
meaning of a tab from the keyboard. The entry of such files is awkward but
their meaning requires no special intrepetation. To change the meaning of
a keyboard tab to 4 enter ctl-u 4 ctl-i. This variable is also saved to
the bindings file, but is not associated with any environmental variables.

Many programmers like what they call autoindent mode. This means new line
acts like ctl-j. To toggle autoindent mode use ESC j. This preference may
also be saved in your bindings file.

The following key bindings have been added.
	DELETE KEY = DELETE
	PAGE UP KEY = PAGE UP
	PAGE DOWN KEY = PAGE DOWN
	END KEY = End of line
	HOME KEY = Beginning of line
	ALT F10 = Toggle Auto-indent (default is Auto-indent = OFF)
	F1 = Get help on word cursor is on ( C or ASM )
	F2 = Visit new file.
	F3 = Search forward
	F4 = Search Backwards
	F5 = Search and Replace
	F6 = Move to next window
	F8 = Save and Exit
	F10 = Close all windows except the one you are in
	ALT F1 = Split the window you are in.
	ALT F3 = Continue search (After ESC S)

If MicroEMACS is not accessed via the console the new bindings may not
work.

Our thanks to W. L. Sheldon for the original form of these changes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ESC-D, ESC-backspace did not delete the kill buffer if there was
intermediate movement before the command. This is fixed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign keyboard users want 0x15 displayed directly. Fixed emacs
so that chars < 0x20 display directly except for \n \t \r \f and esc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The direct display of chars < 0x20 is tied to a display mode switch.
This switch starts off and characters like ctl-q are displayed as
^Q. The display mode switch can be toggled by esc t. If it is on
ctl-q is displayed directly on the screen.

The display mode switch is part of the emacs binding file so a user
may set it for repeated use.
