E12.  VERSIONSF

        Elvis  currently  works  under BSD UNIX, AT&T System-V UNIX, SCO
     XENIX, Minix, Coherent, MS-DOS,  Atari  TOS,  and  OS9/68k.    This
     section  of the manual provides special information that applies to
     each particular version of Elvis.  

        For all versions except MS-DOS, the file  "Makefile.mix"  should
     be  copied to "Makefile", and then edited to select the correct set
     of options for your system.  There is more information  about  this
     embedded in the file itself.  


   E12.1  BSD UNIXF

        Temporary files are stored in /tmp.  

        Elvis doesn't  have  an  "expreserve" program yet.  Instead, you
     should modify /etc/rc so that the temp files are not  deleted  when
     the system is rebooted.  Find a line in /etc/rc which reads 

            rm -rf /tmp/*

        or something like that, and change it to read 

            rm -rf /tmp/[^e]* /tmp/e[^l]* /tmp/el[^v]* /tmp/elv_*

        If  you  do not have permission to modify /etc/rc, then it would
     be unsafe for you to have Elvis store any temp files in /tmp.    In
     this  case,  I  suggest  you  make  a  "tmp" directory in your home
     directory and add "set directory=/your/home/directory/tmp" to  your
     .exrc file or $EXINIT variable.  

        Both  Elvis  and the real Vi read initialization commands from a
     file called ".exrc", but the commands in that file  might  work  on
     one but     not     the     other.          For    example,    "set
     keywordprg=/usr/myself/bin/ref" will work for Elvis,  but  Vi  will
     complain because  it  doesn't  have  a "keywordprg" option.  If the
     warning messages annoy you, then you can edit the config.h file  to
     change  the  name  of  the initialization file ".exrc" to something
     else, such as ".elvisrc".  

        If you use X windows, you  may  wish  to  add  "-DCS_LATIN1"  to
     CFLAGS.   This will cause the digraph table and the flipcase option
     to have  default  values  that  are  appropriate  for  the  LATIN-1
     character set.  That's the standard character set for X.  


   E12.2  System-V UNIXF

        If  your  system uses terminfo instead of termcap, then you will
     have to edit the LIBS setting in the Makefile.  Currently  it  says
     "LIBS=-ltermcap",    but   you   may   have   to   change   it   to
     "LIBS=-lterminfo" or "LIBS=-lterm" or something like that.  









     Elvis 1.4                    VERSIONS                     Page 12-2


        The /etc/rc file  should  be  modified,  as  described  for  BSD
     systems above.   The potential trouble with ".exrc" described above
     for BSD UNIX applies to System-V UNIX as well.  

        Elvis uses control-C as the interrupt key, not Delete.  


   E12.3  SCO XenixF

        For Xenix-386, you can use the generic System-V settings.    You
     may  wish  to add "-DCS_IBMPC" to CFLAGS, to have the digraph table
     and flipcase option start up in a mode that is appropriate for  the
     console.  
     There is  a  separate group of settings for use with Xenix-286.  It
     already has "-DCS_IBMPC" in CFLAGS.  

        Because Xenix is so  similar  to  System-V,  everything  I  said
     earlier about System-V applies to the Xenix version too.  


   E12.4  MinixF

        There  are  separate  settings  in Makefile.mix for Minix-PC and
     Minix-ST.  The differences  between  these  two  are  that  the  ST
     version  uses  ".o"  for  the  object  file  extension where the PC
     version uses ".s", and the PC  version  has  some  extra  flags  in
     CFLAGS to  reduce  the  size  of  Elvis.   The PC version also uses
     tinytcap (instead of the full termcap) to make it smaller.  

        Minix-PC users should read the CFLAGS  section  of  this  manual
     very carefully.  

        The temporary  files  are  stored  in  /usr/tmp.    The /usr/tmp
     directory  must  exist  before  you  run  Elvis,  and  it  must  be
     readable/writable by  everybody.    We use /usr/tmp instead of /tmp
     because after a system crash or power failure, you can recover  the
     altered version  of a file from the temporary file in /usr/tmp.  If
     it was stored in /tmp, though, then it would be lost  because  /tmp
     is probably located on the RAM disk.  

        Elvis uses control-C as the interrupt key, not Delete.  


   E12.5  CoherentF

        Elvis was ported to Coherent by Esa Ahola.  

        Elvis  is  too  large to run under Coherent unless you eliminate
     some features via the CFLAGS setting.  The recommended settings, in 
     Makefile.mix, produce a working version of elvis which emulates  Vi
     faithfully, but  lacks most of the extensions.  You should read the
     CFLAGS section of this manual carefully.  

        You can probably reduce the size of Elvis  by  using  tinytcap.c
     instead of  -lterm.   This would allow you to keep most features of
     Elvis, at the expense of terminal independence.    (Tinytcap.c  has
     ANSI escape sequences hard-coded into it.) 






     Elvis 1.4                    VERSIONS                     Page 12-3


        The temporary  files are stored in /tmp.  You should modify your
     /etc/rc file as described for BSD earlier.  


   E12.6  MS-DOSF

        Elvis was ported to MS-DOS by Guntram Blohm and Martin Patzel.  

        There are  two  different  Makefiles  for  Elvis  under  MS-DOS.
     "Elvis.prj"  should be used with Turbo-C, and "Elvis.mak" should be
     used with MSC and Microsoft MAKE.  The "Elvis.mak"  file  may  work
     with MS Quick-C 

        Elvis stores  its  temporary  files  in  C:\tmp.  If this is not
     satisfactory, then you should edit the CFLAGS line of your Makefile 
     to change TMPDIR to something else before compiling.  You can  also
     control  the name of the temp directory via an environment variable
     named TMP or TEMP.  The directory must exist  before  you  can  run
     Elvis.  

        Normally,  the  TERM  environment variable should not be set, or
     else it should be set to "pcbios".  This way, Elvis will make calls 
     to BIOS to update the screen.  (If you don't like the  colors  that
     the BIOS interface uses, then edit the attr[] table in pc.c.) 

        You  may  prefer  to  use  a  device  driver such as ANSI.SYS or
     NNANSI.SYS, for speed; or you may NEED to use a device  driver  for
     compatibility.   If  so, you should install one of these drivers by
     adding "driver = ansi.sys" to your CONFIG.SYS file, and then define 
     TERM to be either "ansi" or "nansi" by adding a line such  as  "set
     TERM=ansi" to  your  AUTOEXEC.BAT  file.   You must then reboot for
     these changes to take effect.  After that, Elvis  will  notice  the
     "TERM" setting and use the driver.  

        Under  MS-DOS,  Elvis has an extra ":set" option called "pcbios"
     which indicates whether the BIOS is being used directly.  This is a 
     "read only" option; you can't use it to switch your interface style 
     in the middle of an edit session.  

        An extra program, called "wildcard", is needed for MS-DOS.    It
     expands wildcard characters in file names.  


   E12.7  Atari TOSF

        Elvis  was  ported  to  Atari  TOS  by  Guntram Blohm and Martin
     Patzel.  It is very similar to the MS-DOS version.  

        It has only been tested with the Mark Williams C compiler.  

        The TERM environment variable is ignored;  the  ST  port  always
     assumes that  TERM=vt52.   The SHELL (not COMSPEC!) variable should
     be set to the name of a line-oriented shell.  

        A simple shell in  included  with  elvis.    Its  source  is  in
     "shell.c", and the name of the executable is "shell.ttp".  This was 
     necessary because the standard Atari software doesn't offer any way 
     to set environment variables.  The file "profile.sh" should contain 





     Elvis 1.4                    VERSIONS                     Page 12-4


     a  set  of  instructions to be executed when the shell first starts
     up.  An example of this file  is  included,  but  you  will  almost
     certainly want to edit it right away to match your configuration.  

        If  you  already have a command-line shell, then you'll probably
     want to continue using it.  The shell that comes with elvis is very 
     limited.  

        Currently, character  attributes  cannot  be  displayed  on  the
     screen.   In  other  words, the "charattr" option doesn't work very
     well.  Its ironic -- the only system that always  has  a  bitmapped
     display is the only system that doesn't support multiple fonts!  


   E12.8  OS9/68kF

        Elvis was ported to OS9/68k by Peter Reinig.  

        The  Makefile  is  currently configured to install elvis and the
     related programs in /dd/usr/cmds If this this is unacceptable, then 
     you  should  change  the  BIN  setting  to  some  other  directory.
     Similarly,    it   expects   the   source   code   to   reside   in
     /dd/usr/src/elvis; the ODIR setting is used to control this.  

        Temporary files are stored  in  the  /dd/tmp  directory.    Your
     /dd/startup  file  may  need  to  be  modified  to  prevent it from
     deleting Elvis' temporary files.  

        The program in alias.c is linked repeatedly to produce the "vi", 
     "view", and "input" aliases for elvis.  Sadly, the  "ex"  alias  is
     impossible to implement under OS9, because the shell has a built-in 
     command by that name.  

        For  some  purposes,  you  must  give  `make'  the  "-b" option.
     Specifically, you need this  for  "make  -b  clean"  and  "make  -b
     install".
