@To build Elvis release number "almost-but-not-quite-1.4" for Coherent, untar
via the command:

	tar xvUf /dev/fqa0

Copy Makefile.mix to Makefile and then perform the following edits on
Makefile:

	1) delete the leading # from the front of lines 107-128. This
	   uncomments the Coherent specific parts of the Makefile.

	2) on line 107, remove the tab between the = and the .o

	3) on line 112, change /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin

	4) on line 125, change the -c option to a -b

After you finish the changes to the Makefile, simply enter "make" and you
should be able to build a new Elvis/vi/view/ex/ctags/etc...

To install the new versions in your /usr/bin directory, become the superuser
and enter the command:

	make install
