This package requires no modification.  It was very well written by
D. Gwynn (as in NOTES)

Installation is easy.  just move dirent.h and sys.dirent.h to
/usr/include/ & /usr/incude/sys/ respectively (make should do this
as the target "setup:"), and 'make' the library.  Move the library
into the compilation directory or, since you will be using this again
and again, move libndir.a to /usr/lib/libndir.a, and compile with the
ld option -lndir.
