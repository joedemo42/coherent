@The MWC screen generator is designed to build data structures
describing background data and input fields form a simple input file.

	scn xyz

Produces xyz.c with internal structures xyz_data and xyz_locs as well
as any defined fields. It also produces an xyz.h file with externs to
those defined fields and an include of scn.h.

The input file first contains a list of all the fields in order of
appearence in the screen. This is terminated by a %% line.

Each input line must contain
	Field name	A C name for the field. This will normally be built
			in the generated .c file.

	Field Length	The displayed size of the field. One will be added
			to this for zero termination on the internal field.

	Optionaly lines may contain.
	default string	String is a C string with the starting value of the
			field.

	default field	Field is a C field name where the starting value of
			the field may be found.

	help string	String is a C string displayed at the bottom of the
			screen before the field is entered.

	help field	Field is a field name of a C string displayed at the
			bottom of the screen before the field is entered.

	verify routine	Routine is the C name of a function used to check the
			field for validity. A return of 0 means invalid field
			a return of non zero means value. A return of -1
			triggers the skip factor. A return of -2 finishes the
			screen as though ctl-z had been entered.
 
	skip number	Number is the number of fields to skip if the verify
			field returns -1.

	external	Means the field definition for this field is elsewhere
			and prevents scn from building one in it's .c file.

	long		Means that the field is arbitrairly long, its field
			defination will be a char *, and it will be malloc()ed
			as needed.

	readonly	Means the field is readonly.

Examples:

f1 5 default "xyz", verify ver1	# comment to end of line
f2 5 verify ver2
f3 5 verify yNo skip 1 \
	help "Enter n to skip next field"
f4 5

Often it is convienient to input data into arrays of fields.

do 3	
expect 20
send 20
done

Says that there are 3 expect and send fields. This generates 
char expect[3][21];
char send[3][21];

While inside a do group is is legal to use a skip factor of 'group'.
scn will replace this with the number of fields required to skip out
of the current do group.

After %% comes the input screen formatteed exactly as it should appear.
The beginning of each input field should be marked with a '!'. This
may be changed with a designator statement.

desagnator "#"
Causes the field designator to be # not !. The change is for the entire
file.

xyz_data contains the background data for the screen. It is decribed
by the struct backGrnd in scn.h. Each structure is a line of data
followed by its screen position. The array of structures ends with a
data pointer of NULL.

xyz_locs contains the input field data for the screen. It is described
by the struct loc in scn.h. It contains a pointer to the input field
and the row and collumn of the data.

		Driver Functions.

setUpScreen(lines, at)
	This initializes the screen driver and sets up a window for
	error messages or conversational messages. setUpScreen(2, 22)
	reserves line 22 and 23 for messages.

closeUp()
	Shuts down the screen dirver, always call it at the end of job.

showError(s, ...)
	Takes the same format as printf, shows an error message and
	waits for any key to continue.

Query(s, ...)
	Prints a query message waits for any key and returns that key.

clearArea(row, col, len)
	Clears the screen at row, col for len.

showBak(back)
	Displays screen background. showBak(my_data);

clearBak(back, locs)
	Clears the screen background and the area set aside for data.

showDefs(back, fields)
	Show the background and all default data. showDefs(my_data, my_locs);

scnDriv(back, fields)
	Show the background and get all data.

getAll(fields)
	Get and verify all data fields.

getField(fields, field)
	Get one field. getField(my_locs, myString);
	myString must be a field name in your screen file.

putField(fields, field)
	Display one field. putField(my_locs, myString);
	myString must be a field name in your screen file.

numeric(str)
	Returns 1 if str is numeric else 0.

nonNull(str)
	Returns 1 if str has some data in it else 0.

yesNo(str)
	Returns 1 if str is in [yYnN] else 0.

noWhite(str)
	Returns 1 if str contains no whitespace else 0

noVerify(str)
	Returns 1. This is used where no verify routine is given.

checkEnd(str)
	Returns -1 for a null field else 1. This is used for the
	entry of long fields.

This is the source for uuinstall the only sizable program built
by Mark Williams using curses. It was not originally intended for
distribution but is included with the Beta package of curses fixes.

This includes a quick and dirty screen builder, scn.c which
turns collection of field definitions and a screen into a
table. The screen definitions included are comment, choices,
choices1, lsys1, uuin, helpscn, devices, and permis These
show all the screen tricks built into the screen builder.

This package also includes test files L-devices, L.sys, Permissions
and domain which are can be used by uuinstall -d. Normally uuinstall
will use these files in /usr/lib/uucp.

Each input line contains:
	Field name.
	Field Length.	This is zero for read only fields and negative
			for fields where the default value is in a field.
			This defaults to a field long enough to fill the line.
	Default field.	If the field length is 0 for read only this should be
			the true field length. If the field length is negative
			this is a default field, in this case this defaults
			to the field name. Otherwise this is used as a string.
	Verify routine. This is the name of a function which is called with
			the field as a parm. That function should return 0
			if the field is invalid and non 0 if it is valid.
			The default is no verify function.

	Skip factor.	If the verify routine returns -1 Skip factor fields
			are skipped. This allows you to ask a yes or no
			question and skip fields if the is n.
