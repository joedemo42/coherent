Kernel kit for COH 286. -hal-
Directories us (old /usr/sys), i286, coh.286, io.286, and ldrv.
"us" is where master script "bld" resides.
Needs current (/w/sys386/usr/include) headers to build.
Check tools/Makefile for 286 version of asypatch.
Please check that COH 286 still works whenever you change merged code!
