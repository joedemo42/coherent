This is beta version 2 of mwcbbs. It has numerous features over the previous
version.

1. It is no longer necessary to give a filename when invoking mwcbbs.

	A menu of available files/options will be displayed when
	the command is invoked. Once a user is done with a sele-
	ction, the user will be returned back to this menu.
	Leaving this program is done via this menu.

2. The maillist file has been incorporated into mwcbbs. Lists of mwcbbs
   mail accounts can be displayed by U.S. state, country, or 'unknown'
   in the case of mail sites with unknown locations.

3. Net maps have been added. Net maps are broken down into 3 major
   groupings, 'WORLD' (all net maps from mwcbbs), 'US' (United States
   net maps broken down by area code) and 'CAN' (Canadian net maps
   broken down by area code). When selecting net maps from the main 
   menu, a sub menu will appear to prompt for one of the above categories.

The added features should compensate for all of the current workings of mwcbbs.


PLEASE try to see if you can crash this, especially by bouncing between
opening menu options!

To be added:

Print list functions
Color (curses isn't too friendly about color, so no promises on this)


To be considered:

Sorting files by date has been requested. Given the size of some of
these files, no can do in small model. The arrays would get too big
too quickly. Other alternatives are being thought about. All variations
would require an additional data file, which I'd like to keep to a minimum.
Would the current newtobbs file suffice? Let me know...

All feedback is welcome.

**********************************************************************

Here it is, beta version 3, which is probably going to be extremely
close to the first 'real' verison of the mwcbbs utility.

October 30, 1991:

Added and tested - printing Contents listings. Users can specify a
date for printing entries newer than a specific date. Printing of maillists
is not supported, nor is scheduled to be supported.

Added and tested - modifying the default receive directory path. Invoking
mwcbbs with a  '-d directory' will allow users to override the default
receive directory which is /usr/spool/uucppublic.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++ To install:								  ++
++									  ++
++ Copy the program mwcbbs to a local bin directory. It need not be run   ++
++ setuid. 								  ++
++									  ++
++ Copy the data files (Contents*, Maillist, Net*) to a common directory. ++
++ I find that keeping them in /usr/spool/uucppublic is a good place, but ++
++ no one ever accused me of having good taste in these areas.		  ++
++									  ++
++ When running the mwcbbs program, you must be in the directory where	  ++
++ the data files reside, or the program will never find the data files   ++
++ and will only display exit messages.					  ++
