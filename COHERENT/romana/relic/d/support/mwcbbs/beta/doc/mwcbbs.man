After invoking  mmwwccbbbbss, a menu of  six (6) items will
be displayed.  They are:

        0. Contents.down        a listing of public/shareware downloads
	1. Contents.hints       misc. files, archived  news

        5. Net_Maps		available netmaps of world wide *nix sites    
	6. Quit                 exit program

After  selecting an  item (0 -  3 only),  mmwwccbbbbss will
display  filenames  100 at  a time  on the user's  console. Using
arrow keys,  or  the  'vi' keys h,  j, k &  l, a filename  can be
highlited and selected  for downloading.

After  selecting item  4  (Maillist), a  listing of  the 50  U.S.
states and  2 other options  will be displayed. Use  the arrow or
'vi' keys h, j, k, &l to highlite the state/option to display.

After selecting item 5 (Net_Maps), 3 choices of netmap files will
be displayed.  They are:

        0. Net_Maps.WORLD       network maps of *nix sites across the world.  
	1. Net_Maps.USA         networkmaps of U.S. *nix sites by area code
	2. Net_Maps.CAN         networkmaps of Canadian sites by area code
	3. Quit                 exit program

Once an option (0 - 2 only) has been selected, lists of available
netmaps  will  be  displayed on  the  screen.  Just  as with  the
previously described options, move the cursor with the arrow keys
or 'vi' keys h, j, k, or l to highlite and select the desired map
to download. There will  be NO descriptions of netmaps printed to
the screen, only a prompt to download the selected netmap.


mmwwccbbbbss commands:

-_s Select highlited filename for more information and/or
      downloading. Pressing RETURN will also select the file.

-_n Go to next screen (if there are more than 100 files).

-_p Go to previous screen.

-_q Quit mwcbbs.


Once a  filename has been  highlited, other than  the maillist or
netmaps,  more  information  about this file  can be  obtained by
_selecting it.  Once _selected, the information  about the file
will be displayed.


The information displayed includes:

- summary of file (what it does, possible uses)

- date file was added or last updated

- other files which are required for compilation or use of
  selected filename

- other miscellaneous notes which may be of interest

- a listing of system commands to be generated to download the
  selected filename from mwcbbs


After  displaying  the  information  listed  above, a  prompt  to
download the file, or files,  will be displayed.

If  a  file is  more  than  50000 bytes  in  length,  it will  be
downloaded  in  several parts.  When a file is to be  received in 
several parts, it will be necessary  to reconcatenate these parts
into one  large file,  which  should  be  named the  same as  the 
filename selected from the filename selection screen.

When mmwwccbbbbss is invoked with the -pp option,
only the the Contents files will be listed for selection for printing.
Printing of the maillists and net map listings is not supported.

After selecting a Contents file to print, a prompt for specifying
a search date for printing Contents file entries will be displayed.
If a search date is specified, only those entries dated later than the
search date will be printed. If a search date is not specified, then
all of the Contents file entries will be printed. 

Entries are printed to the file m_w_c_b_b_s_._p_r_i_n_t_.

When the entries have been printed, the program will automatically
exit back to the shell.
