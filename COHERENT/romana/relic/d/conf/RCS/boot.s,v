@Fixed boot that allow to boot from arbitrary place of the disk, by
using four byte block numbers. Original (oldest and Ciarian) used
only two byte block numbers -- only the first 32 Meg were accessable.

/ Bootstrap extended to increase max file size from 64 Kbytes to 128 Kbytes.
/ The private code segment is now loaded, where previously it had to be empty.
/ File name editing enhanced to help cursor stay in the 14 char entry field,
/ and to provide a destructive backspace.
