@# This is the configuration file for the dos family of programs

# Blank lines and lines the begin with a # are ignored

# Lines that begin with a '.' are ascii suffix indicators. Files that have 
# one of the extentions are treated as ascii files (CRLF-LF conversion is
# preformed) unless the binary flag is specified.

# Lines of the form str=str are device translators. For example, if you had 
# line 'c=/dev/at0a', the dos programs would translate c: into /dev/at0a.

# This is for a system with a 5.25 inch A drive and a 3.5 inch B drive 
a=/dev/fha0
a9=/dev/f9a0
b=/dev/fva1
bq=/dev/fqa1

# This is for a system with a 3.5 inch A drive and a 5.25 inch B drive 
#a=/dev/fva0
#aq=/dev/fqa0
#b=/dev/fha1
#b9=/dev/f9a1

# Uncoment the lines that correspond to MS-DOS partitions on your hard disk.
c=/dev/at0a
#d=/dev/at0b
#e=/dev/at0c
#f=/dev/at0d

# If you have an extended partition, you can access it by putting a ';number'
# after the device name. For example, you might have a line:
# d=/dev/at0a;1 
# to refer to extended partition 1.
