getnum.c
		The bc lexer requires a number to start with a digit.
		It formerly recognized leading "0" and "0x" as escapes.
		But if ibase > 10 and the leading digit of a number is
		alphabetic (e.g. hex "A000"), a leading "0" is required
		and ambiguity about the base results (octal?).
		Similarly, if ibase > 33, leading "0x" is ambiguous (hex?).
		rec (I think) ripped out the leading "0" and "0x" code
		to avoid this ambiguity.  Since I find hex escapes very
		convenient while leaving the default ibase==10
		(just type "0x1234" to see its decimal value), 	I
		changed getnum() to recognize C escapes "0" and "0x"
		as prefixes for octal and hex numbers if ibase<=10.
