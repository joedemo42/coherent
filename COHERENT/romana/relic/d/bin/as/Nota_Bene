At least one note worth remembering:
	1 - The end of the symbol list in mch/pst.c is marked by the flag
	S_END in the flags field of the last mnemonic in the list.
	If you omit this flag, then the symbol table initialization loop
	will link most of your strings into the symbol table with most
	mystifying results.
