Command line option for full vs. partial character set?
Output character set fix:
	Currently kludged, cf. esc.h.
	The escape characters should be 256, 257, ...
	Buffers and pointers where getf() characters are stored must become
		arrays of int, not char.
Unimplemented requests: cf. request.h and req[01].c/TO_DO.
Unimplemented escapes: cf. esc.h and process.c/TO_DO
Unimplemented registers: cf. getf.c
