There are three system types on which smail can be installed.

	(1) Berkeley with sendmail
	(2) System V with sendmail
	(3) System V without sendmail

	Note: if you have a System III or V7 derived system, you
	can probably treat it like (3).  We have not tested smail
	on such a system.

The installation will vary slightly for each system type.

For all systems you first have to create a 'paths' database.
See paths(8) for details on the file's format.  Then
copy it to /usr/lib/uucp/paths.

Next, edit "defs.h" to configure smail to suit your situation.

Here are step by step installation instructions for each system type.

(1) For a berkeley system with sendmail, the steps are:

	$ make

	$ cp smail /bin/smail

	$ sh make.cf.sh
		<answer the questions it asks>

	$ mv /usr/lib/sendmail.cf /usr/lib/OLDsendmail.cf

	$ cp sendmail.cf /usr/lib/sendmail.cf

	$ /usr/lib/sendmail -bz

	$ mv /bin/rmail /bin/OLDrmail

	$ ln /bin/smail /bin/rmail

(2) For a System V system with sendmail, the steps are:

	$ make

	$ cp smail /bin/smail

	$ ln /bin/mail /bin/lmail

	$ sh make.cf.sh
		<answer the questions it asks>

	$ mv /usr/lib/sendmail.cf /usr/lib/OLDsendmail.cf

	$ cp sendmail.cf /usr/lib/sendmail.cf

	$ /usr/lib/sendmail -bz

	$ rm /bin/mail # (Remember, you still have it in /bin/lmail.)

	$ mv svbinmail /bin/mail

	$ mv /bin/rmail /bin/OLDrmail

	$ ln /bin/smail /bin/rmail

	Note: some implementations of sendmail don't work when the 'U'
	flag is set in the definition of the local mailer (a line that
	begins with "Mlocal" in the generated sendmail.cf).  If you try
	to send mail from a local user to a local user, a message comes
	out that says "No '!' in UUCP! (user)" - and the mail fails.
	If this happens take the 'U' flag out of the sendmail.cf.

	[ the >'s are secondary prompts from the shell,
	  and ^M is 'carat' 'M', not 'control-M' ]

	$ ed sendmail.cf <<!
	> /^Mlocal/s/SU/S/
	> w
	> q
	> !

(3) For a System V system without sendmail, the steps are:

	$ make

	$ cp smail /bin/smail

	$ mv /bin/mail /bin/lmail

	$ mv svbinmail /bin/mail

	$ mv /bin/rmail /bin/OLDrmail

	$ ln /bin/smail /bin/rmail

You're done.
