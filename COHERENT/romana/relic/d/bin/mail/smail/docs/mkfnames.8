.SH NAME
mkfnames \- create full name database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkfnames [ file  ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mkfnames
uses the named
.I files
as input and writes a sorted database suitable for
use as the full name database for
.IR smail (8)
on the standard output.
The format of an input line is defined by
.IR nptx (8).
If no
.I files
are specified, then the password file is
used to parsed and an attempt is made to
munge it into the format needed by
.I nptx.  No guarantees on this, since
there are so many bizarre password file
formats.
