Install COHERENT update

install installs an update  of the COHERENT system onto your hard
disk.  id  identifies the update to be  installed.  device is the
device from  which the update disks will be  read.  ndisks is the
number of disks that comprise the update.

***** Example *****

The following installs COHERENT update coh.301, which consists of
one disk, from a high-density 5.25-inch floppy drive:


        /etc/install coh.301 /dev/fha0 1

Building distribution kits for use by install


/etc/install  provides   a  standardized  mechanism   to  install
upgrades and add-on software to the COHERENT system.

install is invoked with a command line of the form:


             /eettcc/iinnssttaallll _i_d _d_e_v_i_c_e _n_d_i_s_k_s


where id specifies the  update or add-on package to be installed,
device is the ``mountable'' block device from which the update or
add-on package will be installed, and ndisks specifies the number
of diskettes in the distribution.

The id field  should be formed from the set  of upper- and lower-
case letters,  as well as digits, the period  (.), and the under-
score (_)  character.  Its length cannot  exceed nine characters.
Field device  should be selected from  the standard block-special
floppy-disk devices.

***** Distribution Details *****

Distributions  usable by  install consist of  a set  of mountable
floppy  disks, each  containing a  file  system created  by mkfs.
This allows  the diskettes  to be  independent of each  other and
also allows  the user to insert the diskettes  in any order.  in-
stall records the fact that it has read a given diskette from the
distribution, thus preventing  the user from attempting to read a
given diskette more than once during an installation session.

Diskettes should  be built using mkfs,  with possible input being
generated by unmkfs.  Each diskette in the distribution must con-
tain a file of the form


             /_i_d._s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e


in the  root directory.  Here,  id must match  the aforementioned
field of the  same name.  The sequence part of  the file name in-
dicates which diskette in the distribution this diskette is, from
one through the total number of diskettes.

install uses  the command cpdir to copy  each of the distribution
diskettes to  directory / on the  current system.  Therefore, all
diskettes should be  ``root based'' (i.e., full path names should
be used).  Because install is run by the superuser, cpdir preser-
ves the date and time  for each file, and preserves ownership and
modes.  To  keep file ownership consistent  with COHERENT conven-
tions, make  files that  are neither  setuid nor setgid  owned by
user bin  and group bin.   Directories found on  the distribution

diskettes will  be created on the target  file system, as needed.
Be careful  when choosing the  ownership and mode  of directories
because  your  system's  security  could  inadvertently  be  com-
promised.

***** Postprocessing *****

After  all diskettes  in  a distribution  have been  successfully
copied, install checks for the existence of a file of the form


             /conf/_i_d.post


where id matches the id  field found on the install command line.
If   found,  install   executes  this   file  to   allow  special
``postprocessing,'' such as installing additional manual pages or
performing installation-specific commands.

Before you complete your postprocessing, you should remove any id
files of the following form from the target system:


             /conf/_i_d.post
             /_i_d._s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e


***** Adding Manual-Page Entries *****

As  part of  building a  distribution, you  will usually  need to
generate pre-processed or ``cooked'' manual-page entries for dis-
tribution  with your  upgrade  or add-on  package.  These  should
reside in  subdirectories of /usr/man, with the  name of the sub-
directory being specific to your product.  This naming convention
avoids  name-space collisions,  should multiple  applications use
the same name for a manual-page entry.

If you  install new or  additional manual pages,  you must update
the index file used by  the man command to locate manual entries.
File /usr/man/man.index on  the target file system contains index
entries  for  all  manual  pages  on  the  system.   As  part  of
postprocessing, you will  generally need to append index informa-
tion for your manual pages to the end of the existing index file.
In  addition, file /usr/man/man.help  contains the  man command's
help message.  This includes a  list of valid topics and some ex-
planatory text.  You should also append to this file a brief list
of the manual page entries  that you have added.  For further in-
formation on manual pages,  see the Lexicon entry for the command
man.

***** Logging *****

install logs  all partial as  well as completed  installations in
file  /etc/install.log.    This  information  includes  date/time
stamps and the command line arguments to install.
