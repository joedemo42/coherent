exec2.c

		In syntax(), report error at EOF with appropriate message.
sh.y

		for efficiency.

Makefile
		V3.4.3: changed VERSION passing in var.c compilation,
		in keeping with var.c change below.
eval.c
		Allow ${?} etc. for special variables in addtion to the
		usual form $?, for the benefit of the Lotus install script.
var.c
		Change $VERSION from readonly to ordinary, for Lotus install.

Mon Mar 22 11:03:10 1993 PST
exec1.c
		V3.4.4: in command(), case NIF, add:
			else if (np->n_next == NULL)
				slret = 0;		/* exit status 0 if no elsepart */
		to set exit status correctly for when no else part, e.g.
			if false
			then
				echo false
			fi
		which previously returned 1, now returns 0; cf. P1003.2 3.9.4.4.
		In code below, after break2, change
			sesp->s_con = sesp->s_con->c_next;
		to
			if (sesp->s_con != NULL)
				sesp->s_con = sesp->s_con->c_next;
		because Michael found the old version core dumping
		during WordPerfect install without this change.

Sun Apr  4 00:57:37 1993 PST
main.c
		Changed initial trap handling to disallow <Ctrl-C>
		out of "+sh" invocations.  Previously, a user could log in
		by hand as uucp (for example) and <Ctrl-C> would abort the
		uucp .profile before the specified shell took effect.
