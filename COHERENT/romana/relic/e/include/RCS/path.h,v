 * Path lookup.

 * Path takes a path search list, a file name, and an access mode,
 * and searches each directory in the path list
 * for a file with the given name and access mode.
 * The constructed pathname, which is kept in a static buffer,
 * is returned on success.
 * NULL is returned if either pointer argument is NULL,
 * or if the search failed.
