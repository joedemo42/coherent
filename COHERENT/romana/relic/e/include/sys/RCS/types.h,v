@/*

 * Revised: Wed Apr  7 15:15:05 1993 CDT
 */

/*
 * This header is defined in the POSIX.1 standard ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990, and as
 * such client programs which include this program may not use any symbols
 * which end in "_t".
 */

/*
 * The contents of this header are also defined by the provisions of binary
 * compatibility standards such as the iBCS2 specification and the System V
 * ABI. The visibility of certain symbols defined by those standards may be
 * controlled by feature-test macros such as _SYSV3 for iBCS2, and _SYSV4 for
 * System V, Release 4.
 *
 * System headers which depend on this file for definitions should take care
 * when using symbols that have different definitions under the _SVR3 and
 * _SVR4 environments. This header defines both versions under internal names
 * beginning with o_ for SVR3 and n_ for SVR4, and then uses one of those
 * definitions as the base for the external definition.
 */

/*
 * Other symbols may be defined in this header according to the provisions of
 * the System V, Release 4 Multiprocessor DDI/DKI, which defines additional
 * symbols. The visibility of symbols unique to the DDI/DKI is controlled by
 * the _DDI_DKI feature-test macro. Headers in the DDI/DKI are part of the
 * kernel environment, and should not depend on the _SVR3 or _SVR4 feature-
 * tests.
 *
 * The rationale for all of this is to ease the transition between providing
 * an iBCS2 service (which is not, and indeed cannot be POSIX-compliant) and
 * an SVR4 service (which provides a POSIX-compliant service using interfaces
 * that are not binary compatible). Kernel code must use a single consistent
 * set of data declarations even when attempting to provide a service which
 * uses conflicting definitions.
