@/*
 * /usr/include/sys/core.h
 *
 * Core file header struct.
 *
 * Revised: Thu Apr  8 12:04:29 1993 CDT
 *
 * ch_magic		should be CORE_MAGIC - see below
 * ch_info_len		number of bytes in "ch_info" header (in case of change)
 * ch_uproc_offset	offset in bytes from just after ch_info to uproc struct
 *
 * As of r75, a COH 386 core file consists of a ch_info struct, followed by
 * memory segments for the process, in this order:
 *
 * SIUSERP	0			User area segment
 * SIPDATA	2			Private data segment
 * SISTACK	3			Stack segment
 * SIAUXIL	4			Auxiliary segment
 *
 * Since it is already available, the following segment is omitted:
 *
 * SISTEXT	1			Shared text segment
 *
 * Sizes and virtual addresses for each segment are available from the
 * u_segl field of the uproc struct.  Shared memory segments, and possibly
 * interesting parts of the proc struct, do not occur in the core file as
 * of this writing. -hws-
