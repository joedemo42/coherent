 * This is an internal header file, not intended for general use.
 *
 * This is a registry of value and constants for the lock hierarchy values
 * recommended for use in internal DDI/DKI basic and read/write locking
 * operations. Many of these hierarchy values are outside the range that
 * are permitted to DDI/DKI-compliant drivers, and a special value in the
 * "lk_flags" member of the "lkinfop" structure passed to LOCK_ALLOC () is
 * necessary to permit access to this range of hierarchy values.
 *
 * We also specify a recommended minimum priority value here which should be
 * used with the indicated lock whenever a specific value is not indicated.
