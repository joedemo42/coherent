 * We can provide a greater level of error checking/reporting if we know we
 * are running on a uniprocessor. Use this feature-test macro to control
 * compilation of code for uniprocessors.
 *
 * Note that many of the traditional simplifying assumptions about
 * uniprocessor systems may not apply if basic-lock acquisition can schedule
 * interrupt contexts (ie, if the system is designed such that interrupts
 * need not be turned off). Such as system would behave effectively like a
 * multiprocessor, although most of the extra checking could still be valid
 * with information gained from the interrupt-handler scheduling system.

/*
 * For greater scalability, a "ticket lock" should be preferred over a basic
 * test-and-set or test-and-test-and-set spin lock, since it guarantees
 * FIFO ordering and reduces the level of memory contention (important for
 * multiprocessor shared-memory cache performance). See the paper cited at the
 * top of this file for more details.
 *
 * However, ticket locks take slightly more memory and are slightly slower
 * that basic test-and-set spin locks, so we only use them in situations
 * where we expect them to be needed.

 * Even if ticket locks are used, in the absence of a fetch-and-increment
 * atomic operation a basic test-and-set style lock must be used to control
 * the "ticket gate", so the style of test-and-set lock used will always have
 * consequences. A simple test-and-set spin lock reduces delay, while a
 * test-and-test-and-set spin reduces contention.
