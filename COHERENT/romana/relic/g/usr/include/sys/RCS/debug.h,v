/*
 * This header defines debugging macros suitable for use in an operating
 * system kernel. There can be a variety of handling disciplines in place
 * for each different class of internal problem, depending on whether or
 * not this is a production or debugging system (and on the presence of some
 * kind of debugger which we might like to call upon).
 *
 * One aim is that the code which is being developed should be able to pass
 * the strictest of "lint"-style checks. In the past it has often been the
 * case that developers have not taken certain classes of diagnostics
 * seriously, especially where the return value of a function is not used.
 *
 * In an operating system kernel, it is *never* safe to assume that any
 * function that returns a value can have that value ignored. Even if there
 * is no sane corrective action that can take place, developers should be
 * able to expect assert ()-style checks will catch such "impossible"
 * conditions.

/*
 * The ASSERT () macro evaluates it's argument and checks for a non-zero
 * (boolean TRUE, in the C language) result. If any other value is returned,
 * an assert ()-style diagnostic is issued to the system console via
 * cmn_err () with a severity of CE_WARN.
 *
 * The name ASSERT () indicates that the value of the test expression is just
 * that, a test, and may not be evaluated if the system is compiled with
 * debugging facilities suppressed.
