/*  
 * This internal header file is intended to be the sole point of definition  
 * for the internal data type "__paddr_t", which is used as the basis of the  
 * definition of the internal kernel data type "paddr_t".  
 *  
 * The semantics of this type are not well-defined. Any access to a data item 
 * of this type or a type derived from it is non-portable, and is not  
 * guaranteed to remain the same across releases of the operating system.  
 * Not even the size of such an item can be assumed to remain constant, so  
 * use of such an item in a structure visible to user or driver code is  
 * prohibited. [ Exception; certain header files from earlier releases of the 
 * Coherent operating system defined such structures, which remain in the  
 * current release but which are being phased out. Therefore, access to those 
 * structures is similarly non-portable by transitivity, and developers are  
 * cautioned to find portable alternatives. ]
