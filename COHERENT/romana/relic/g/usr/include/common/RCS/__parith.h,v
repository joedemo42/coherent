/*
 * This internal header file is intended as the sole point of definition for
 * the internal data type "__ptr_arith_t".
 *
 * This type is used to represent the smallest unsigned integral type to which
 * a C-language pointer can be safely converted without loss of information
 * and vice versa. This type is not guaranteed to be able to safely hold the
 * values of pointer types with implementation-specific decoration such as
 * a "far" attribute, or such implementation-specific entities as physical
 * addresses.
