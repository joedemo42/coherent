/*
 * This internal header is designed to factor out the definition of NULL
 * from all other aspects of the STREAMS and device systems. In order to
 * be able to create a reasonable facsimile of the STREAMS and DDI/DDK
 * programming environments, many of the header files defined by those
 * documents in the System V environment have been defined. From the POSIX
 * and ISO C standards documents we learn that <sys/types.h> is the most
 * likely candidate, but that definitions also occur in <stdlib.h>, <stdio.h>
 * and many other places.

/*
 * For Borland C++, the use of memory models requires that we define NULL
 * appropriately. There is a special Borland header for this, however.
