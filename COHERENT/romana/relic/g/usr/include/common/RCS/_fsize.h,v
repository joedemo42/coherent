/*
 * This internal header file is intended as the sole point of definition for
 * the Coherent data type "fsize_t". This type is intended to abstract the
 * notion of file size for Coherent utilities to aid in migration to file
 * systems capable of representing files more than 2^32-1 bytes in size.
 *
 * Historically, Coherent has exported this type to the user through the
 * <sys/types.h> header, but it has also been implicitly defined by various
 * other headers; there has never been any documented point of export.
 *
 * This type is never exported to the user if _POSIX_SOURCE is defined. Macros
 * for accessing items for this type are not yet defined; users of this type
 * should be aware that it may not remain a scalar type. Use of this type in
 * portable software is strongly discouraged.
