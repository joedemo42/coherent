@#ifndef	__COMMON__INTMASK_H__
#define	__COMMON__INTMASK_H__

/*
 * This internal header contains a definition for a data type used to hold
 * interrupt masking information. It is not formally specified whether this
 * type is arithmetic or non-arithmetic, and no portable uses for it have been
 * defined. It exists in the common space for use by the kernel configuration
 * mechanisms included in the base system.
 */

/*
 * If we are using interrupt masking to define our interrupt priority scheme,
 * then we need a type sufficient to hold a bitmask for at least 16 vectors
 * (for the IBM PC). Defining this as a long integer should be sufficient
 * for now.
