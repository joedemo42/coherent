To build uucp, cd to tay104's individual subdirs or unix, lib and uuconf.
Run 'make' in each of these dirs.

Next, cd back to tay104 and then run 'make' there. This will produce the entire
suite of Taylor UUCP binaries. Remember, we don't ship them all.

To build uuinstall and uutouch, just cd to their dirs and run 'make'.
