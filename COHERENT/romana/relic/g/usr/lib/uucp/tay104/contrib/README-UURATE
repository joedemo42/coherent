See the man page for documentation.

Installation:
------------

(1) Copy Makefile.uurt to Makefile.

(2) Edit Makefile: set BIN where you want uurate to be installed, and
    set CFLAGS to point to the directory containing the UUCP sources
    (this is .. by default).

(3) Type ``make'' to compile the program.

(4) Type ``make install'' to install the program.

(5) Install the man page if you want. I didn't put that into the Makefile.
