	 Now we could remove the file (and, if the file mode disallows
	 writing, that's what we have to do), but we try to avoid
	 doing so since it causes a race condition.  If we remove the
	 file, and are interrupted any time after we do the read until
	 we do the remove, another process could get in, open the
	 file, find that it was a stale lock, remove the file and
	 create a new one.  When we regained control we would remove
	 the file the other process just created.

	 These files are being generated partially for the benefit of
	 cu, and it would be nice to avoid the race however cu avoids
	 it, so that the programs remain compatible.  Unfortunately,
	 nobody seems to know how cu avoids the race, or even if it
	 tries to avoid it at all.

	 There are a few ways to avoid the race.  We could use kernel
	 locking primitives, but they may not be available.  We could
	 link to a special file name, but if that file were left lying
	 around then no stale lock could ever be broken (Henry Spencer
	 would think this was a good thing).

	 Instead I've implemented the following procedure: seek to the
	 start of the file, write our pid into it, sleep for five
	 seconds, and then make sure our pid is still there.  Anybody
	 who checks the file while we're asleep will find our pid
	 there and fail the lock.  The only race will come from
	 another process which has done the read by the time we do our
	 write.  That process will then have five seconds to do its
	 own write.  When we wake up, we'll notice that our pid is no
	 longer in the file, and retry the lock from the beginning.

	 This relies on the atomicity of write(2).  If it possible for
	 the writes of two processes to be interleaved, the two
	 processes could livelock.  POSIX unfortunately leaves this
	 case explicitly undefined; however, given that the write is
	 of less than a disk block, it's difficult to imagine an
	 interleave occurring.

	 Note that this is still a race.  If it takes the second
	 process more than five seconds to do the kill, the lseek, and
	 the write, both processes will think they have the lock.
	 Perhaps the length of time to sleep should be configurable.
	 Even better, perhaps I should add a configuration option to
	 use a permanent lock file, which eliminates any race and
	 forces the installer to be aware of the existence of the
	 permanent lock file.

	 We stat the file after the sleep, to make sure some other
	 program hasn't deleted it for us.  */
