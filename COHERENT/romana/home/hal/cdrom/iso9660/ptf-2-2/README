9660_u (ISO-9660 Utilities) README, 930111
==========================================

Version 1.1 of 9660_u (January 11, 1993)

Bill Siegmund dug into the ISO-9660 documentation and pulled out enough
information to write some low-level user-mode code for reading ISO-9660
discs.  Rich Morin tweaked the code a bit and added some shell scripts as
frosting.  Neither Bill nor Rich is totally happy with the results, but
they agree that it is far better than nothing, and give it to you as a
starting point, tool, or what have you.  The relevant files are:

  HISTORY	change history log
  NOTES		from 1-2 booklet Troubleshooting section.
  README	this file
  catsub.c	cat specified CD-ROM data to standard output
  cd_dirs.c	generate raw list of CD-ROM directories
  cd_files.c	generate raw list of CD-ROM directories and files
  cdcat		cat specified CD-ROM file to standard output
  dir_rec.c	read and process designated Directory Record block
  full		generate full list of disc's contents
  get_file.c	interactive CD-ROM data retriever
  makefile	build C programs

Rich suggests the following plan for using these tools:

  1)	Build the C programs.  They currently compile under SVR4 and
	A/UX 3.0; for anything else, you're on your own.

  2)	Find out the name of the raw CD-ROM device on your system.  On
	Rich's A/UX box, it is /dev/dsk/c3d0s31, where the 3 specifies
	SCSI ID 3.  You may, for convenience, wish to link the name to
	something more mnemonic (e.g., /dev/cd).

  3)	Run "full" to generate a sorted index list, as:

	  full /dev/cd > 1-2a

  4)	Use "grep" to find the full path names of desired files.

  5)	Extract the files using "cdcat", as:

	  cdcat 1-2a /dev/cd language/0.doc > language_0.doc

Future development could take any of several paths.  The current mess of
scripts and C code might be turned into something with a reasonable user
interface.  Alternatively, A user-mode NFS server daemon could be written,
allowing ISO-9660 CD-ROMs to be mounted as if they were UNIX file systems.
Finally, vendor software might become mature enough that this sort of hack
would no longer be necessary.  Stay tuned...
