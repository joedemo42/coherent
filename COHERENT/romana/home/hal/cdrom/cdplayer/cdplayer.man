     This manual page  documents the ccddppllaayyeerr program.  This is a
     simple utility  for playing Audio CD's  on a supported CDROM
     drive.  The   program  uses  the  Sun   ioctl  interface  to
     communicate the appropriate commands to the CDROM. A special
     routine  is provided  at compile time  to support  NEC CDROM
     drives that require special calls to enable Audio mode.

     ccddppllaayyeerr first checks to see if the CDROM drive is currently
     mounted. If  it is an  error is returned and  the program is
     aborted. Otherwise, the command provided is executed.

     ccddppllaayyeerr gives a quick and easy  when to play an Audio CD on
     a UNIX system from the  command line.

     _p_l_a_y Play  an  Audio CD  starting  at track  1.  If a  track
          argument is  given and the  track number is  valid, the
          play  command  will start  playing  from the  specified
          track.

     _s_t_o_p Stops an Audio CD that is currently being played.

     _i_n_f_o Displays info on the  Audio CD in the CDROM drive.  The
          total number  of tracks,  total playing time,  and time
          per track  is displayed, as  well as the  status of the
          drive and current track in play.

     _p_a_u_s_ePauses the Audio CD currently in play. If the CD is not
          currently playing,  then the command  does nothing. The
          _r_e_s_u_m_e command must be used to restart a paused CD.

     _r_e_s_u_m_e
          Resumes a playing Audio CD that has been paused. If the
          CD has not been paused, the command is ignored.

     _e_j_e_c_tEjects an Audio  CD from the CDROM drive. This function
          will  only  work  on  a  CDROM  drive  supporting  this
          feature. For example,  the Mitsumi CDROM drive does not
          support this feature.

     _s_k_i_p Skips the  Audio CD to the next track.  If the Audio CD
          is on the last track, then ccddppllaayyeerr will play the first
          track on the Audio CD.

     _v_o_l_u_m_e
          Adjusts the volume  for the CD. This command requires a

          parameter of a number  between 0 and 255. The volume of
          the CDROM  drive will be set to  this value.  Note, not
          all drives support this feature.

          If no  command line  options are provided,  the program
          print a usage message, displays the available commands,
          and exit with a non-zero status. If an error occurs, an
          exit status of 1 is returned.

          Sets the CDROM  device to open. This permits redefining

     Feel free  to comment on  the program's useful/useless-ness.
     If you  find this program works with  your CDROM, please let
     me  know the  brand and  model.  I'd like  create a  list of
     "compatible drives".

     The  nec_ioctl code  was  borrowed from  xcdplayer-NEC.tar.Z
     found  on tsx-11.mit.edu  in /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom.  This is
     not    my    code    and    apparently   is    written    by
     rusty@belch.berkeley.edu.   This    code   segment   appears
     unmodified.
