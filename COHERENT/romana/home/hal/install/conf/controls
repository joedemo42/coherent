# localfeed:  if set to "on" will add a form-feed between each copy of
#             a request to the local printer.
#
#
#localfeed=on


# feed:       works like localfeed for all other requests other than
#             local ones.
#
#feed=on

# docopies:   If it is set to "on" then the despooler will send the request
#             to the backend script X number of times, where X is the number
#             of copies.  Otherwise, the despooler will only send the data
#             once and the backend is expected to send X copies to the
#             device from its one copy of the request.  In either case, the
#             backend is sent the number of copies as the $3 positional
#             parameter.  If you want to print alot of copies and you want
#             the status to report an accurate assesment of the job's 
#             stage of completion, then set docopies to on.

docopies=on

# printer     This relates a logical printer name with a physical device
#             and optional backend script.  There must be one entry for each
#             printer.  The default backend is simply the "cat" command.
#             The lpadmin command defines printers by writing such line here.
#
#printer=fast,/dev/lpt0

# default     This is the system default printer.  If the user does not have
#             a personal default printer defined (see "route") then this is it.
#             You can use lpadmin to change this too.

# templife    These three options determine the how long a request will live
# shortlife   in the spool queue.  In most Unix spoolers, this is not even a
# longlife    consideration, since the data simply flows to the printer and
#             is then gone.  There are four classes or request longevities:
#
#             R = Reprint.  These requests are headers without data. They
#                           are removed as soon as they despool.
#
#             T = Temporary  These live for just 1/2 an hour before being
#                            deleted.
#           
#             S = Shortterm  These live for 24 hours.
#
#             L = Longterm   These live for a week.
#             
#             The default times for T, S & L's may be overridden with the
#             keywords listed in this section.  The despooler enforces these
#             lifetimes during a queue scan once every tenth time it is 
#             awakened.  During slow times this is once every 300 seconds.

# logroll     This is the time at which the log file is renamed to log.o
#             and a fresh log file is begun.  The time is expressed in hours
#             and defaults to a week.  This is done so that the log file
#             does not grow without bounds.
