# /usr/adm/distrib/CompressList

# Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are comments in this file.

# This file contains the list of directory trees to be archived and
# compressed on the distribution.

# The first field is the root of the directory tree to be compressed.
# This directory is rm'ed from the uncompressed distribution after the
# compressed version is created, so, you may specify a subtree, then its
# parent, for compression and avoid duplication.

# The second field is the resulting output name.  The extension (suffix)
# for the compressed library name determines what compression method is
# used, and must match the uncompression method used in install.c.

#	Extension	Uncompression Method in install.c

#	*.taz		/usr/bin/gtar -xzfv $Archive
#	*tar*		/usr/bin/gunzip -c $Archive | /usr/bin/ustar xf -
#	*cpio*		/usr/bin/gunzip -c $Archive | /usr/bin/cpio -icdmu

# Both file names are relative to the root of the distribution.

# Additional fields are appended to the command used to create the
# compressed file.
